0,pc photo printers challenge pros home printed pictures can be cheaper and higher quality than those from high street developers tests shows a survey carried out by pc pro magazine looked at which of 100 home photo printers offered a better deal than handing your snaps to a photo lab the tests found that images from top pc printers kept their colour longer than professionally produced photographs but using the wrong printer cartridge could means snaps fade in months warned the magazine the group test of 100 home photo printers for pcs discovered how much it costs to create images using the devices compared to online developers as well as high street names such as jessops boots and snappy snaps the comprehensive test also revealed how quickly different printers produced images the quality of the finished image and how resistant finished pictures were to smudging or water damage it found that although some ink for printers now costs more than 2 per millilitre it can still be cheaper to produce prints from photographs at home than it is to send them off to a high street store if you really like your photos then it s definitely worth printing at home instead of going to the high street but only if you choose the right printer said nick ross top tester at pc pro mr ross said that a new generation of printers produced images with brighter colours and that were less likely to fade than many high street developers or even some professional wedding photographers some high street photo shops can be the cheapest when it came to developing prints that were 6x4in said mr ross but the test revealed that images 7x5in and 8x10in in size were cheaper to produce at home according to pc pro producing a print 8x10in on an epson r800 printer using top quality paper costs 1 87 at jessops the same image would cost 2 50 and at snappy snaps 9 99 a 10x7in snap at boots would cost 4 99 considering how inconvenient it can be to go to the high street and how silver halide prints can fade in the sun we re adamant that it s now better cheaper and more convenient to print at home he said ann simpson marketing manager at snappy snaps believes the convenience of high street printing will continue to attract customers some people will want to do their own thing on their computer but the feedback to us is that customers often have to print two or three pictures at home in order to get a good one she said many people are not skilled at getting the colour contrast and cropping right and they don t want the hassle she added the magazine test found that which ink consumers use determined how long their prints lasted before they started fading it recommended avoiding so called third party inks not produced by printer makers because they tended to produce prints that fade the quickest

1,japan s ageing workforce built to last in his twenties he battled tuberculosis for eight years then went on to run his own clothing business before marrying in his late thirties and the 101 year old torao toshitsune has eaten raw fish pretty much every day throughout his life mr toshitsune is one of japan s 23 000 centenarians a club that is growing by 13 annually and where the oldest member is 114 at his neat osaka detached house where he lives with one of his sexagenarian daughters mr toshitsune keeps a regular routine of copying out buddhist sutras and preparing the traditional japanese tea ceremony between tasks this remarkably active senior citizen reveals what his next goal is well what s most important for me is to be japan s number one mr toshitsune wants to outlive everyone and when it comes to longevity japan as a country appears to be doing just that women can expect to live until 85 men until 78 four years longer than americans and europeans on the outskirts of kyoto 83 year old yuji shimizu contemplates this phenomenon during a round of golf with his younger friends who are in their seventies i think this is because the food industry and the environment have improved he remarks on average we can live longer whether it s the diet or the traditional family structure where roles were clearly defined or just something in the genes japan s elderly are remarkable but while life may be a game of golf for mr shimizu his grandchildren have huge problems ahead japan is the world s least fertile nation with childbirth rates of just two thirds of that in the us by 2007 japan s population is expected to peak at 127 million then shrink to under 100 million by the middle of the century this means 30 million fewer workers at a time when the number of elderly will have almost doubled in the year 2050 if the birth rate remains the same people over 60 will make up over 30 of the population explains shigeo morioka of the international longevity centre in tokyo so how will japan s finances stay on track after a decade of economic stagnation and huge deficit spending the public sector debt is already about 140 of the country s gross domestic product gdp the highest rate among industrialised countries the international monetary fund predicts that as the falling birth rate takes grip from 2010 the cost of running japan s welfare state will double to more than 5 of gdp while current account balances will deteriorate by over 2 but unfortunately japan appears poorly prepared both financially and politically glen wood vice president of deutsche securities japan asks who s going to fund the pension fund for the next generation and indeed who are going to be the new japanese worker who is going to build the economy who are going to be the leaders who are going to be the producers of the gdp going forward one option is further welfare reform another is immigration possibly from the philippines and indonesia but so far any emerging policy appears restricted to a limited number of nursing staff standing next to tokyo harbour is a version of new york s statue of liberty but as yet japan is not ready for an ellis island japan has never really liked that option in its history and i think it s an option that s becoming more and more plausible and necessary insists mr wood in japan as in europe which also faces a workforce decline immigration is a very sensitive subject but for the japanese economy facing 8 fewer consumers by 2050 means slumping domestic sales of cars hi tech kit and home appliances perhaps even another property crash of course the japanese could always have more children the government is currently considering financial rewards for procreative couples similar to those in operation in australia but there would be no pay back until 2030 when today s babies are taxpayers and the demographic crisis like in europe starts to unfold in 2010 in contrast to japan and of course the european union the us population is expected to increase by 46 to 420 million by the middle of the century although president bush must re devise social security to take account of a 130 rise in america s over 65s the imf foresees a positive contribution to the us current account balance from the combined forces of fertility and immigration some voices in japanese industry are calling for radical changes to the nature of the japanese labour market they want a shift towards financial services though doubts persist over the country s ability let alone willingness to move away from manufacturing japan still has problems getting a viable banking system let alone shifting their auto business or their semi conductor business or the broad based tech manufacturing business overseas says mr wood japan can either drive some radical reforms or else run the risk of a vicious ageing recession falling demand and a lower tax take could result in soaring budget pressures and a basket case currency come 2020 japan could be more dependent on a shrinking workforce than any other industrialised power there are fears that the world s number two economy is doomed to a permanent recession but none of this is mr toshitsune s concern anymore at 101 he chuckles that he feels fine

0,apple laptop is greatest gadget the apple powerbook 100 has been chosen as the greatest gadget of all time by us magazine mobile pc the 1991 laptop was chosen because it was one of the first lightweight portable computers and helped define the layout of all future notebook pcs the magazine has compiled an all time top 100 list of gadgets which includes the sony walkman at number three and the 1956 zenith remote control at two gadgets needed moving parts and or electronics to warrant inclusion the magazine specified that gadgets also needed to be a self contained apparatus that can be used on its own not a subset of another device in general we included only items that were potentially mobile said the magazine in the end we tried to get to the heart of what really makes a gadget a gadget it concluded the oldest gadget in the top 100 is the abacus which the magazine dates at 190 a d and put in 60th place other pre electronic gadgets in the top 100 include the sextant from 1731 59th position the marine chronometer from 1761 42nd position and the kodak brownie camera from 1900 28th position the tivo personal video recorder is the newest device to make the top 10 which also includes the first flash mp3 player diamound multimedia as well as the first successful digital camera casio qv 10 and mobile phone motorola startac the most popular gadget of the moment the apple ipod is at number 12 in the list while the first sony transistor radio is at number 13 sony s third entry in the top 20 is the cdp 101 cd player from 1983 who can forget the crystalline hiss free blast of madonna s like a virgin emenating from their first cd player asked the magazine karl elsener s knife the swiss army knife from 1891 is at number 20 in the list gadgets which could be said to feature surprisngly low down in the list include the original telephone 23rd the nintendo gameboy 25th and the pulsar quartz digital watch 36th the list also contains plenty of oddities the pez sweet dispenser 98th 1980s toy tamagotchi 86th and the bizarre ronco inside the shell egg scrambler 84th why worry about mobile phones soon they will be subsumed into the pda s laptops etc what about the marine chronometer completely revolutionised navigation for boats and was in use for centuries for it s time a technological marvel sony net minidisc it paved the way for more mp3 player to explode onto the market i always used my netmd and could not go anywhere without it a laptop computer is not a gadget it s a working tool the sinclair executive was the world s first pocket calculator i think this should be there as well how about the clockwork radio or gps or a pocket calculator all these things are useful to real people not just pc magazine editors are the people who created this list insane surely the most important gadget of the modern age is the mobile phone it has revolutionalised communication which is more than can be said for a niche market laptop from outside the modern age the marine chronometer is the single most important gadget without which modern transportation systems would not have evolved so quickly has everyone forgot about the breville pie maker an interesting list of the electronic gadgets thousands of journalists in the early 1980s blessed the original noteboook pc the tandy 100 the size of a4 paper and light three weeks on a set of batteries an excellent keyboard a modem a pity tandy did not make it dos compatible what s an apple powerbook 100 it s out of date not much of a gadget surely it has to be something simple timeless the tin opener swiss army knife safety razor blade wristwatch or the thing for taking stones out of horses hooves it has to be the mobile phone no other single device has had such an effect on our way of living in such a short space of time the ball point pen has got to be one of the most used and common gadgets ever also many might be grateful for the pocket calculator which was a great improvement over the slide rule the casio pocket calculator that played a simple game and made tinny noises was also a hot gadget in 1980 a true gadget it could be carried around and shown off all top 10 are electronic toys so the list is probably a better reflection of the current high tech obsession than anyhting else i say this as the swiss army knife only made no 20 sinclair ql a machine far ahead of its time the first home machine with a true multi takings os shame the marketing was so bad apple a triumph of fashion over well everything else utter rubbish yes the apple laptop and sony walkman are classic gadgets but to call the sextant and the marine chronometer gadgets and rank them as less important than a tv remote control reveals a quite shocking lack of historical perspective the former literally helped change the world by vastly improving navigation at see the latter is the seed around which the couch potato culture has developed no competition i d also put apple s newton and the first palm pilot there as the front runners for portable computing and possibly the toshiba libretto for the same reason i only wish that vulcan inc s flipstart wasn t just vapourware otherwise it would be at the top how did a laptop ever manage to beat off the challenge of the wristwatch or the telephone mobile or otherwise what about radios and tvs the swiss army knife by far the most useful gadget i got mine 12 years ago still wearing and using it a lot it stood the test of time psion organiser series 3 should be up there had a usable qwerty keyboard removable storage good set of apps and programmable case design was good batteries in the hinge a first i think great product innovation the first mobile pc was voted best gadget by readers of err mobile pc why do you keep putting these obviously biased lists on your site it s obviously the mobile phone or remote control and readers of a less partisan publication would tell you that the motorola startac should be number one why there will be mobile phones long after notebook computers and other gadgets are either gone or integrated in communications devices the psion series 3c the first most practical way to carry all your info around i too would back the sinclair spectrum without this little beauty i would never have moved into the world of it and earn the living that i do now i d have put the mobile phone high up the list probably a nokia model sinclair spectrum 16k it plugged into the tv games were rubbish but it gave me a taste for programming and that s what i do for a living now i wish more modern notebooks even apple s newest offerings were more like the pb100 particularly disheartening is the demise of the trackball which has given way to the largely useless trackpad which every notebook on the market today uses they re invariably inaccurate uncomfortable and cumbersome to use congratulations to apple a deserved win

2,dallaglio his own man to the end controversy and lawrence dallaglio have never been very far away from each other throughout a glittering international career even the end of his nine year career came out of the blue just four days before the start of the season but then dallaglio has always been his own man ever since emerging onto the international scene dallaglio has polarised opinions to supporters of england dallaglio could do no wrong an integral part of a sustained period of success for england dallaglio s crowning glory was his part in the side that won the rugby world cup in 2003 rival fans meanwhile have tended to take an alternative view seeing dallaglio as the epitome of the less agreeable characteristics of english rugby never afraid to speak his mind be it to the referee or the opposition on the pitch or his coach or the media off it dallaglio has sometimes rubbed people up the wrong way dallaglio arrived as part of the unheralded england side which became the shock winners of the first rugby sevens world cup in 1993 it took him another two years to graduate to the full england xv but once there he proved to the manor born displaying maturity and physical power beyond his years dallaglio rapidly established himself as an automatic choice able to play any one of the three back row positions at international standard within two years of his debut dallaglio was offered the england captain s band and his career continued to go from strength to strength as he made the 1997 lions tour to south africa although overlooked for the captaincy in favour of england team mate martin johnson he played a massive role in the 2 1 series victory but after building up a seemingly unstoppable momentum dallaglio s career hit the buffers at speed in 1999 first came the last minute defeat to wales in which dallaglio s decision not to kick for goal in the dying minutes was blamed for costing england a grand slam worse was to follow though as an infamous newspaper sting cost him his treasured england captaincy with sensational allegations of drug use of which he was subsequently cleared splashed across the front pages a devastated dallaglio stepped down as england skipper but he bounced back getting his head down at club level before returning to the england fold albeit now as a lieutenant to new captain johnson as a member of a new look england side on the long road to world cup glory a journey not without mishaps as a succession of grand slams opportunities were spurned dallaglio emerged as a key performer once again yet another setback arrived in 2001 as a serious knee injury cut short dallaglio s involvement on the lions tour to australia rumours began to circulate that his career was over but in typical dallaglio style he embarked on a punishing schedule of rehabilitation to return an even more fearsome physical specimen one effect of the injury was to rob dallaglio of much of his pace but ever the pragmatist he reinvented himself as a close quarters number eight of the highest calibre the only player to play every minute of england s world cup triumph in australia dallaglio could hardly have done more to secure england s historic win and for that he will always be held in the highest esteem by england supporters following johnson s retirement dallaglio s career came full circle as woodward restored him as england captain while england did not hit the heights in dallaglio s second spell as captain losing five of their eight post world cup tests dallaglio led by example leaving him as one of the few members of a squad lacking many world cup stars to live up to expectations dallaglio walks away from the international game safe in the knowledge that he will go down as one of england s most accomplished players if not one of the great captains despite his evident pride in leading his country the problem now for england is how to replace the almost irreplaceable the likes of matt dawson jonny wilkinson phil vickery and hill have all been mentioned as contenders for dallaglio s role as captain but it is as a player that england will really struggle to replace the 32 year old although players like joe worsley and chris jones are more than capable of stepping up the fact that there is no stand out candidate speaks volumes about dallaglio s massive influence on english rugby
2,henson stakes early lions claim the six nations may be a glittering prize in itself but every player from the four home unions will also have one eye on a possible trip to new zealand with the lions this summer the player who staked the biggest claim for a place in the starting xv over the weekend was gavin henson he s very confident you just had to listen to his interview afterwards he beamed with confidence but although there s an element of arrogance it s good arrogance he certainly showed some nice touches he once showed a clean pair of heels to mathew tait when he got outside him his defence was very good and he made some great kicks out of hand and that s without even mentioning his majestic match winning penalty but i think we need to wait and see what happens because he needs to be put to the test he needs to come up against brian o driscoll or a big french midfield wales fly half stephen jones was another player who impressed me he gave good direction he was very confident and he was a nice general for his side he showed he can control a game with jonny wilkinson not playing at the moment due to inury the number 10 shirt could be up for grabs and jones or maybe even henson could make the lions team at fly half jones stuck his hand up and he certainly looks a better bet than charlie hodgson after saturday s game some of the wales forwards surprised me because i thought they would be out muscled in the tight five england prop julian white is a capable player but when it comes down to selection gethin jenkins is now going to have the upper hand because he came out on top however i still think white and phil vickery will be in the frame some english players did their cause no harm i thought joe worsley had a solid game and jason robinson and josh lewsey both did nothing wrong but it looked too soon for young mathew tait and i think it will be a while before we see him again despite being written off beforehand several scots caught my eye against france tom smith has been there and done it before but the likes of chris cusiter jason white and ally hogg all made their mark hogg made a couple of good runs while white had a pretty robust game his defence is right up there cusiter looked very lively and he could be a very good option for lions coach sir clive woodward the star of ireland s win over italy in rome looks like a certainty to make the starting xv against new zealand brian o driscoll is a class act he ran some good lines against italy made the breaks and fed his outside backs although italy defended man on man which made it easy for him gordon d arcy was unlucky to go off injured early on but i think you could get a henson d arcy o driscoll combination in the lions midfield paul o connell just needs to add a hard edge to his game and malcolm o kelly keeps on going and seems to be putting his hand up while shane byrne seems to be a lively character but they will be a bit worried after the italian pack drove them off their own ball on sunday although i used to play in italy and i know how difficult it can be one player who didn t impress me was wales scrum half dwayne peel he choked late on in the second half when wales were trailing they had good possession and he kicked the ball away i wouldn t want him as my lions scrum half after that
4,could rivalry overshadow election tony blair and gordon brown are desperately trying to stuff the genie of their rivalry back into the bottle along with any number of senior cabinet colleagues they are insisting their only job is to win the next election and govern in the best interests of britain it is a message they are aiming directly at their backbenchers who are becoming irritated and even unnerved by the continuing claims and counter claims surrounding this alleged rift ian gibson for example urged the two men to stop squabbling declaring for goodness sake sometimes you have to rise above petulance and make sure that you do your job as effectively as you can those with slim majorities are particularly fearful that the rift could hit their own hopes of re election tony blair will seek to reassure labour mps on monday evening at their first meeting of the new year at westminster a behind closed doors meeting which gordon brown is thought likely to also attend to show unity meanwhile the likes of health secretary john reid and labour peer lord haskins are warning of the electoral dangers of allowing this soap opera to continue and they have both warned the rival camps to stop spreading the poison lord haskins even suggested mr blair should reinstate mr brown as the central figure in the election planning but this particular genie is unusually reluctant to return to captivity and many fear it is simply too late to repair the damage they believe they will be fighting the next election with the sounds of open warfare between the two men ringing in their ears and it matters little whether the rift is real or as some try to suggest simply the product of newspaper headlines and westminster gossip few in westminster actually believe that simply because the evidence appears to contradict it for example the weekend s attempts by both men to play down the divisions failed to do the trick even as they were both insisting on their unity of purpose and claiming they would not be swayed by newspaper stories they still managed to stir the speculation with their comments mr blair talked about the new labour manifesto a move which seemed calculated to irritate the chancellor who has long rejected the label and mr brown pointedly refused to deny claims the prime minister had reneged on a deal to hand him the premiership last year that claim was repeated in robert peston s book a book which amply demonstrates this corrosive downing street soap opera is nowhere near its final act for his part mr brown insists his only motivation was to get labour re elected the trouble is both men have fallen short of offering simple straightforward denials of the central claims so they have both been accused of actually making matters worse by feeding the speculation with their own behaviour the first thing to be said is that these suggestions have not come from nowhere they started with and are sustained by friends of the two men one only had to listen to the chancellor s friend and former spin chief charlie whelan last week to understand that there is a real anger from this camp at the prime minister s apparent attempts to confound mr brown s leadership ambitions but it is not just public pronouncements from ex aides there are whispered briefings to selected journalists from both sides it is no secret in westminster for example that downing street believes the chancellor is indulging in a mammoth sulk and acting in a petty and deliberately provocative manner then there are the actions of the men themselves gordon brown sets out what is seen as a rival manifesto then appears to embark on his own personal campaign the prime minister responds by scheduling his monthly press conference to clash with a keynote speech by the chancellor meanwhile large numbers of backbench mps insist voters are either entirely uninterested in the chatter which they believe is a media only obsession or that they fear for the efficient running of a government beset by such rivalry either way there is universal agreement that if this goes on through the general election it can only do the labour party serious damage there are signs that the two men appreciate the dangers and both want to put a lid on all the speculation but with probably only four months to the next election that looks like being a particularly difficult trick to pull off
4,no election tv debate says blair tony blair has said he will not take part in a tv debate with his political rivals ahead of the next election we answer this every election campaign and for the reasons i have given before the answer is no he said at his monthly news conference in october tory leader michael howard said mr blair would be running scared if he refused calls to go head to head in recent years the leader of the opposition has always called for a debate although it has never happened before the 2001 election plans for a debate between mr blair william hague and charles kennedy collapsed in 1997 a debate between mr blair and john major was also cancelled when a format could not be agreed televised debates have become the high point of the us presidential election campaigns

for an investment package of a size and stature that will restore liverpool to their place at european football s top table but it is a challenge that appears to sit easily with parry who has forged a

the crucial months ahead he only dodged one question when asked to reveal the name of the mystery investor currently courting liverpool a polite smile deflected the inquiry but to his credit he met everything else head on in measured tones that underscore the belief that liverpool still mean business by business he means becoming title challengers again and locking the pieces together that will

club with a unique history and expectations this will not come as news to parry a lifelong liverpool supporter but his quiet determination suggests he is no mood to be found wanting captain gerrard is central to liverpool s plans and parry s insistence that all offers will be refused is a firm statement of intent as ever the player will have the final say and parry acknowledges that but he is

withdrew his 70m offer he was also convinced his interest was being used to lure in others so any new approach would now have to come from liverpool morgan will certainly not be making another call so speculation continues about the new benefactor with trails leading to the middle east and america but all met with an understandable veil of secrecy from anfield parry meanwhile sees the new ground as crucial to liverpool s future but is refusing to become emotionally attached to the idea he is determined the ground will only be built on an affordable basis and will not make future liverpool management hostages to the new stadium parry will pull back the moment the figures do not stack up but there has been a vital new development in north london that has re shaped liverpool s thinking liverpool have publicly refused to entertain the idea of stadium sponsorship and potential naming rights but the realism of arsenal s stunning 100m deal for their new emirates stadium at ashburton has changed the landscape parry labelled the deal an eye opener and admits liverpool would be missing a trick not to explore the possibilities he knows some traditionalist liverpool fans will reel at any attempt to call the new stadium anything other than just anfield but the maths of modern day football decree that multi millions for stadium and team could ease the pain i would take 50m if we had no investment but if we did keep him as for the stadium if it gets us cash what difference does it make really 50m for gerrard i don t care who you are the directors would take the money and it is the way it should be we cannot let that sum of money go despite gerrard s quality through a cleverly worded statement the club has effectively forced gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself which i think is the right thing to do critical time for liverpool with regards to gerrard ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term i am hoping he doesn t walk out of the club like michael owen did for very little cash 50m realistically would allow rafa to completely rebuild the squad however if we can afford to do this and keep gerrard we will be better for it i would however be happy with gerrard s transfer for any fee over 35m parry s statements are clever in that any future gerrard transfer cannot be construed as a lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players upping the ante is another smart move by parry i would keep gerrard no amount of money could replace his obvious love of the club and determination to succeed the key is if gerrard comes out and says that he is happy clearly if he isn t then we would be foolish not to sell the worrying thing is who would you buy or who would come pending possible non champions league

0,file swappers ready new network legal attacks on websites that help people swap pirated films have forced the development of a system that could be harder to shut down one site behind the success of the bittorrent file swapping system is producing its own software that avoids the pitfalls of the earlier program a test version of the new exeem program will be released in late january but doubts remain about the new networks ability to ensure files being swapped are quality copies in late december movie studios launched a legal campaign against websites that helped people swap pirated movies using the bittorrent network the legal campaign worked because of the way that bittorrent is organised that file sharing system relies on links called trackers that point users to others happy to share the file they are looking for shutting down sites that listed trackers crippled the bittorrent network one of the sites shut down by the legal campaign was suprnova org which helped boost the popularity of the bittorrent system by checking that trackers led to the movies or tv programmes they claimed to now the man behind suprnova org who goes by the nickname sloncek is preparing to release software for a new file swapping network dubbed exeem in an interview with novastream web radio sloncek said exeem would combine ideas from the bittorrent and kazaa file sharing systems like bittorrent exeem will have trackers that help point people toward the file they want like kazaa these trackers will be held by everyone there will be no centrally maintained list this said sloncek should make the system less vulnerable to legal action aimed at stopping people swapping pirated movies and music the exeem software has been under development for a few months and is currently being tested by a closed group of users an early public version of the software should be available before february sloncek said that currently only a windows version of the software was in development there were no plans for a linux or mac version he said that costs of writing the software will be paid for by adverts appearing in the finished version of the program despite suprnova administrator sloncek s involvement with exeem the basic technology appears to have been developed by a firm called swarm systems that is based on caribbean island saint kitts and nevis users of the exeem system will be able to rate files being swapped to help stop the spread of fake files sloncek told novastream dr johan pouwelse a researcher at the delft university of technology who studies peer to peer networks said exeem was the next evolution in file sharing systems but he said it would struggle to be as popular as bittorrent and suprnova because early versions were not taking enough care to make sure good copies of files were being shared exeem cannot prevent pollution he said the rating system in exeem seems flawed because it is easy to insert both fake files and fake ratings he said studies have shown that organisations working for record labels and movie studios have worked to undermine kazaa by putting in fakes by contrast moderators on suprnova made sure files being shared were high quality the moderators are the difference between having a system that works and one that s full of crap like kazaa he said there is a fundamental tension between distribution and integrity he said mr pouwelse said that future versions of file sharing systems are likely to incorporate some kind of distributed reputation system that lets moderators prove who they are to the network and rate which files are worth downloading when big files were being shared moderation systems were key said mr pouwelse he added that the legal attacks on bittorrent had driven people away from sites such as suprnova but many users had simply migrated to other tracker listing sites many of which have seen huge increases in traffic it s hard to compete with free he said no one from the motion picture association of america was immediately available for comment on the file sharing development

1,glazer makes new man utd approach malcolm glazer has made a fresh approach to buy manchester united which could lead to a bid valuing the premiership club at 800m the us tycoon who has been wooing the club for the last 12 months has approached the united board with detailed proposals it has confirmed mr glazer who owns the tampa bay buccaneers team hopes this will lead to a formal bid being accepted his new offer is expected to contain substantially less debt mr glazer has already had one takeover attempt turned down by the red devils and responded by using his 28 1 shareholding to vote off three board members last november man united had turned down the bid because it was based on a high level of borrowing but newspapers have speculated recently that the tycoon had gained the support of leading banks to come up with a stronger and less debt laden bid last week however mr glazer issued a statement to the stock exchange distancing himself from a new bid meanwhile united s chief executive david gill said in december that talks would not resume unless glazer came up with definitive proposals now the board has confirmed that the us bidder is back with a statement issued on sunday reading the board can confirm it has now received a detailed proposal subject to various preconditions which may form the basis of an offer a further announcement will be made in due course to succeed malcolm glazer will still need the approval of major shareholders john magnier and jp mcmanus who own 28 9 of the club but the irish duo have cut off talks with glazer over the proposed sale of their stake and have so far made no comment on his latest approach united fans have reacted with anger at the announcement they have vehemently opposed any proposed takeover by glazer since he first showed interest in the club in september 2003 and after sunday s announcement they vowed to fight on we will fight tooth and nail to stop him whatever his offer says we do not want him or anybody else taking over united said mark longden of the independent manchester united supporters association the campaign against this proposed takeover will continue as it has done since glazer first showed interest in the club
3,roundabout continues nostalgia trip the new big screen version of the magic roundabout released in the uk on friday is the latest attempt to turn children s television into box office gold recent years have seen a less than successful adaptation of the 1960s puppet show thunderbirds and a moderately successful version of e nesbit s five children and it previously filmed by the bbc in 1991 he man and transformers which were cartoon favourites in the 1980s will soon receive their own costly makeovers with screen versions of the a team the dukes of hazzard and even blake s seven on the cards nostalgia is clearly big business but some critics complain that these expensive takes on iconic series of yesteryear do not match up to our fond memories of the originals the new version of the magic roundabout which will be released as sprung in the us replaces the stop motion models of the 1960s tv show with polished computer generated animation in a similar fashion the 2004 thunderbirds used human actors and special effects in place of the original s puppets and models the films are squarely pitched at younger audiences pop stars robbie williams and kylie minogue provide voices in the magic roundabout while the now defunct boy band busted performed the thunderbirds theme song but while some reviewers have been won over there has nonetheless been a significant backlash this cg animated adventure airbrushes the sly charm and trippy otherworldliness which made the 60s stop motion roundabout a cult hit writes stella papamichael on the bbc movies site and the recent puppet comedy team america world police was in part provoked by its directors outrage that gerry anderson s thunderbirds was remade without its signature mannequins dan jolin reviews editor of empire magazine says classic children s tv shows have a built in audience that make them ideal for reinvention i can understand why people are taking these intellectual properties and repackaging them for the kids of today but i think it s backfiring what s next the clangers on some distant planet with some giant cgi soup dragons chasing after them despite thunderbirds disappointing global box office performance the film cost 42m 22m but only recouped 21m 11m the nostalgia craze shows no signs of abating it can therefore be only a matter of time before some other tv favourites receive the hollywood treatment after the success of garfield the movie britain s shabby tabby surely deserves his own film vehicle with only 13 episodes made of the 1974 series there is plenty of room to explore the lives of the pink cat professor yaffle and the mice of the marvellous mechanical mouse organ furry recyclers have already had one big screen outing 1977 s wombling free but with environmental issues still occupying our thoughts it is high time they made a comeback advances in special effects technology could do wonders for the bbc s supernatural comedy and the success of pirates of the caribbean must surely herald a comeback for tv s most popular cartoon buccaneer it might also remind viewers the lewd character names often associated with the show never actually existed the magic roundabout is out in the uk on 11 february how about bringing catweazle to the big screen he could give gandalf a run for his money thundercats i loved it should be fun to see on the big screen if some effort is put in it will bring my youth back get your hands off the clangers is nothing sacred make a movie version of the banana splits what about keanu reeves and richard gere in a remake of the wooden tops or perhaps robbie williams could get his much mooted acting career off the ground by taking on the role of andy pandy you forgot to mention the grearest of them all danger mouse but then again it couldn t be better than the original series could it it s always nice to see these old toons re released but after the abysmal thunderbirds movie and the song i think i ve been completely put off just leave these classics alone as good memories i think remakes are a good idea as the world moves on people tend to look more and more into the past to things that make them feel safe i believe this is the whole reason retro has become so popular as long as a remake does justice to the original then all it can do is create a wider audience and possibly entice a new generation of persons to enjoy and revive and old series personally i d like to see cartoons such as transformers thundercats and m a s k get full hollywood remakes leave them alone why ruin something that we all have very fond memories of in the first place the thunderbirds film was apalling not a patch on the puppet series i grew up with and the magic roundabout will never be the same without the voice of eric thompson love to see transformers with real actors and cgi and make it at least a 15 rating part of the reason for the success of such classics as the magic roundabout was that the characters were not the sweet and cuddly creatures that you would expect they were moody sarcastic and rather human just looking at the pictures of the animations for the new film show that these characteristics have not been preserved dougal never smiled like that films of this sort have an unfortunate habit of disneyfying everthing and they just lose the real magic that made the show special in the first place i have fond memories of bod not least of which because i look like him and would like to see someone attempt to make it into a film it s got all the right material for an american blockbuster no plot and no story bod would likely be played by tom cruise and would undoubtedly have a girlfriend or two it s all very well and good remaking these classic tv shows and films with all the latest technology for a new audience but for me a lot of the original charm is lost when they do this and seems more like a money making exercise to cash in on the original success of the programme than reinventing or improving it it maybe that to an audience who have never seen the originals they can watch them without prejudice but to people who have grown up with all these shows such as thunderbirds and magic roundabout which are part of our childhood they are never going to live up to expectation it does pose the question though that with all the long line of remakes being made are film makers running out of original ideas all i can say is bring back danger mouse probably the greatest kids show ever i recently re watched some episodes and realised that there was a level of humour shown in danger mouse that was completely lost on me when i was a child there was a new captain pugwash cartoon made a couple of years back again like so many of these nostalgia programmes the animation this time computer created flat cell like animation failed to match the original s cut out paper technique for inventiveness and was woefully inadequate we live in a sampling world the music industry has been pludering past decades for inspiration clipping sounds from 20 years ago is much cheaper and easier that doing something new seems that the film and tv is doing the same now it s just cheaper to take ideas from the past and rework them rather than being daring and trying something new it got to be mr benn the story line about a man who changes in a fancy dress shop steps into a door way and appears in another time and place would be amazing if they got a decent producer and writer the story line could be great and who to play the lead role well if it was a comedy then it would have to be someone like steve martin if its going to be an adventure then johnny depp playing a role similar to the pirates of the caribbean character muffin the mule perhaps after all grannies and grandpas go to the cinema as well you know why can t the british film industry try making gerry anderson s ufo or captain scarlet or saphire and steel or the tomorrow people in today s media it seems the past is the future tv shows such as battlestar galactica have new remakes dj s are sampling or re working 70 s and 80 s music even computer games from 10 15 years ago are getting modern re workings personally i think it shows that no one has any originality any more why not just leave our misty eyed nostalgia alone mary mungo and midge but of course for most of the episodes the lift would be out of order and they would have to use the stairs plus would mary be more of a vicky pollard character as she lives in a high rise council block yeah but no but i wasn t even there i d like to see mr benn with brad pitt in the title role sean connery could play the mysterious costume shop owner it demonstrates a profound lack of imagination in today s film makers that they continually try to remake and remodel the past in an effort to cash in on nostalgia there are plany of modern children s book that would make excellent films or tv programmes why not use them instead of rehashing the past mr benn with rowan atkinson as the lead would have loved to see dungeons dragons made but unfortunately the film that it was made into didn t come up to scratch the only one that isn t to be remade as yet is thundercats which i d like to see i m an expat living in norway and i recently went through a period of buying the dvds of many of my favourite children s programs for my 2 daughters my dearest wish however is to see a feature length version of noggin the nog appear on the big screen very scandinavian rainbow i believe that childrens classics should be left well alone and i will not be surprised if the magic roundabout does not do well at the box office especially since it will be going up against the spongebob squarepants movie popular among children because it s original witty and modern the magic roundabout will never appeal to the children of today as it did all those many years ago how about classics like chorlton and the wheelies rentaghost terrahawks bod oh the list could go on and on if a transformers movie is indeed on the cards then i ll be the first one on amazon buying a copy eagerly waiting at the front door with a frothy mouth and a nervous twitch repackage my childhood and sell it to me at an extortionate price i don t care till then i ll have to make do with the citreon c4 advert i d luv to see willow the wisp on the big screen but sadly without the late kenneth williams doing the voices it wouldnt be the same and who remembers trap door voiced by the late willie rushden superb children s programme could morph hold his own in a big screen movie or even jamie and the magic torch hmmmmm i could go on and on danger mouse at 34 i m showing my age noggin the nog was one of the best children s programs the problem with bringing it to the big screen is that no one could approach oliver postgate s wonderful voices so in general leave well alone the originals are good because they are of their time and the methods used are an integral part of the story just imagine what could be achieved by using cgi in a remake of fingerbobs the already disturbing hand antics of the bearded hippy yoffi could take on a whole new level with a more life like fingermouse bob the builder postman pat and fireman sam together in an epic adventure of fire post and bricks in the ultimate struggle to save the women they love from the evil clowns krusty and gobo will they triumph or will they fail miserably find out this fall one puppet show that i personally would love to see made into a live action movie is joe 90 it would be worth the price of admission alone to see the large screen version of joe s car of course gerry anderson s supermarionation is a rich seam of material worthy of big screen big budget action it was only that thunderbirds the movie was targetted as a children t movie that really let it down after all the children that remember those shows with such affection are now the parents of children themselves it s only because the people who were children when these programmes were first shown have grown up and are plundering their childhoods isn t it i d hate to see bagpuss with perfect animation i love that done in a shed clunkiness and you couldn t recreate the magic perhaps if the remakes were done in a look around you mock authentic style i might be interested chorton and the wheelies or jamie and his magic torch that would be mega this re gurgitation of old films and tv shows makes me angry it is corporate laziness resting on the safety of other people s ideas because it guarantees to bring in the the same can be said of modern day pop bands who release other peoples material will young etc the sad fact is nostalgia sells big bucks in the short term the fact that they will be forgotten in 6 months time is irrelevant e g starsky hutch hence the market is saturated with this mindless drivel but it can only be stopped if people stop buying it i pray they never do a remake of chorlton and the wheelies i m only 27 and don t remember the series from when it was on tv but have the set on dvd and it s a classic the fact it s so great comes from the fact that there were very few special effects involved and compared to today s stuff it looks amateurish thats the appeal though it s so innocent like chorlton himself and it would be a real shame if they did remake it

1,turkey turns on the economic charm three years after a gruelling economic crisis turkey has dressed its economy to impress as part of a charm offensive ahead of 17 december when the european union will decide whether to start entry talks turkey s economic leaders have been banging the drum to draw attention to recent achievements the economy is growing fast they insist education levels among its young and large population are rising unemployment levels in percentage terms are heading fast towards single digits inflation is under control a new law to govern its turbulent banking system is on the cards the tourism industry is booming and revenues from visitors should more than double to 21bn 10 8bn in three years moreover government spending is set to be frozen and a burdensome social security deficit is being tackled income and corporate taxes will be cut next year in order to attract 15bn of foreign investment over the next three years a loan restructuring deal with the international monetary fund imf is pretty much in the can and following recent macroeconomic restructuring efforts its currency is floating freely and its central bank is independent the point of all this has been to convince europe s decision makers that rather than being a phenomenally costly exercise for the eu allowing turkey in would in fact bring masses of economic benefits the cake will be bigger for everybody said deputy prime minister abdullatif sener earlier this month turkey will not be a burden for the eu budget if admitted into the eu turkey would contribute almost 6bn euros 8bn 6bn to its budget by 2014 according to a recent impact study by the country s state planning organisation as turkey s gross domestic output gdp is set to grow by 6 per year on average its contribution would rise from less than 5bn euros in 2014 to almost 9bn euros by 2020 turkey could also help alleviate a labour shortage in old europe once its population comes of age by 2014 one in four turks or about 18 million people will be aged 14 or less a literate and qualified turkish population insisted mr sener will make a positive impact on the eu this runs contrary to the popular view that turkey is getting ready to dig deep into eu taxpayers wallets however turkey s assertions are confirmed by brussels own impact studies which indeed say that turkish membership would be good news for the eu economy but only over time costs are projected to be vast during the early years of turkey s membership with subsidies alone estimated to exceed 16 5bn euros and according to some predictions balloon to 33 5bn euros this would include vast agricultural subsidies and regional aid though such payments should decline as the country s farm sector which currently employs one in three turks would employ just one in five by 2020 such high initial expenses would be coupled with risks that the benefits flagged up by turkey s government would never be delivered say those who feel the turkish project should be shunned some fear that rather than providing an educated sophisticated labour force for europe at large the people who will leave turkey to seek work abroad will be poor uneducated and plentiful more recently less palatable concerns at least in liberal european circles have been voiced with senior eu or member state officials talking darkly of a river of islam an oriental culture and a threat to europe s cultural richness of course many opponents are politically motivated their views ranging from xenophobic prejudices about the country s muslim traditions to well documented concerns about the government s human rights record yet their economic arguments should not be dismissed out of hand critics insist that much of the optimism about turkey s economic roadmap has been over egged an argument amplified by a 134 rise in the country s current account deficit to 10 7bn during the first 10 months of this year the country s massive debt which includes 23bn owed to the imf and billions borrowed via the international bond markets also remains a major obstacle to its ambition of joining the eu in the new member states of the european union gross public debt is typically about 40 of gross domestic product says reza moghadam assistant director of the imf s european department at about 80 of gdp turkey s gross debt is double that figure turkey s debts have largely arisen from its efforts to push through banking reform after a run on the banks in 2001 caused the country s devastating recession there is no question that although turkey is doing much better than in the past it remains quite vulnerable says michael deppler director of the imf s european department its debt is far too high for an emerging economy a key factor for eu decision makers should be whether or not turkey has met its economic criteria but economics is not a science and although the state of turkey s economy is important as is its pace of reform the final decision on 17 december will be taken by politicians who will of course be guided by their political instincts

0,no half measures with half life 2 could half life 2 possibly live up to the hype after almost two years of tantalising previews and infuriating delays it s safe to say that this is the most highly anticipated computer game of all time fortunately it doesn t merely live up to its promise but exceeds it no one who plays the finished product will wonder why it took so long the impression is of a game that has been endlessly refined to get as close to perfection as could realistically be hoped all the money or indeed time is on the screen the player sees things through the eyes of gordon freeman the bespectacled scientist who starred in the original 1998 half life having survived that skirmish in an desolate monster infested research facility he s back in another foreboding troublespot the enigmatic city 17 it has the look of a beautiful eastern european city but as soon as your train pulls in to the station it s clear that all is not well here sinister police patrol the unkempt streets and the oppressive atmosphere clobbers you like a sledgehammer a casual smattering of the nightmarish creatures from the first game makes this an even less pleasant place to be you are herded around like a prisoner and have to mingle with a few freedom fighting civilians to gather information and progress in your task it is not immediately explained what your objectives are nor precisely why everything is so ravaged finding out step by step is all part of the experience although you never fully get to understand what it was all about that does not really matter hl2 does not waste energy blinding you with plot underplaying the narrative in this way is gloriously effective and immerses the player in the most vivid convincing and impressive virtual world they are likely to have seen there are no cut scenes to interrupt the flow exposition is accomplished by other characters stopping to talk directly to you whereas the highly impressive doom iii felt like a top notch theme park thrill ride wandering through half life s world truly does feel like being part of a movie considering its sophistication the game runs surprisingly well on computers that only just match the modest minimum specifications but if ever there was an incentive to upgrade your pc s components this is it on our test machine an alienware system with an athlon 3500 processor and ati s radeon x800 video card everything ran at full quality without trouble and the visual experience was simply jaw dropping it is not simply that the surfaces textures and light effects push the technical envelope without mercy but that such care and artistic flair has gone into designing them the haunting grim landscapes become strangely beautiful luckily you get time to pause mid task and marvel at the awesome graphical flourishes of your surroundings so impressive are the physics that you ll find yourself hurling bits of rubbish around and prodding floating corpses just to marvel at the lifelike way they move there are puzzles to be solved along the way pitched at about the right difficulty but most progress is achieved by force freeman is quickly reunited with the original game s famous crowbar and an array of more sophisticated weapons soon follow virtually anything not nailed to the floor can be interacted with and in realistic fashion you will be wowed by the attention to detail as you chip bits of plaster off walls chase a pigeon out of your way or dodge exploding barrels as they ping around at deadly speed at times half life 2 feels like one of those annoying people who are unfeasibly brilliant at everything they turn their hand to and in a curious way its unrelenting goodness actually becomes almost tiresome running around on foot is great enough but jumping into vehicles proves even more fun human foes are rendered just as well as alien ones the stealth sections are as exhilarating as the open gun battles in gameplay terms hl2 somehow gets almost everything perfect and without resorting to the zombies leaping out of shadows approach of doom iii it s all incredibly unsettling the vacant environment is distinctly eerie and at one point i even caught myself hesitating to go down a murky tunnel for fear of what might be inside the game does have a couple of problems firstly the carefully scripted way that you progress through each level might irk some people a lot of things are meticulously choreographed to happen on cue which makes for exciting moments but may be an annoyance to some players and limit the appeal of playing again once you ve completed it if you like things open ended and free ranging far cry will be a lot more pleasing but the real downside is the hassle of getting the game to run installing it proved a life draining siege that would test a saint s patience developer valve has rashly assumed that everyone wanting to play the game will have an internet connection and it forces you to go online to authenticate your copy the box does warn you of this anti piracy measure but does not say just how many components have to be downloaded the time spent doing this will depend on your connection speed the temperamental valve servers and the time of day but it can take hours it would take a mighty piece of work to feel worthwhile after such annoyances but luckily half life 2 is up to the challenge it is surely the best thing in its genre and possibly many will feel of any genre the bar has been raised and so far out of sight that you have to sympathise with any game that tries to do anything remotely similar in the near future half life 2 is out now for the pc

0,intel unveils laser breakthrough intel has said it has found a way to put a silicon based laser on a chip raising hopes of much faster networks scientists at intel have overcome a fundamental problem that before now has prevented silicon being used to generate and amplify laser light the breakthrough should make it easier to interconnect data networks with the chips that process the information the intel researchers said products exploiting the breakthrough should appear by the end of the decade we ve overcome a fundamental limit said dr mario paniccia director of intel s photonics technology lab writing in the journal nature dr paniccia and colleagues haisheng rong richard jones ansheng liu oded cohen dani hak and alexander fang show how they have made a continuous laser from the same material used to make computer processors currently says dr paniccia telecommunications equipment that amplifies the laser light that travels down fibre optic cables is very expensive because of the exotic materials such as gallium arsenide used to make it telecommunications firms and chip makers would prefer to use silicon for these light moving elements because it is cheap and many of the problems of using it in high volume manufacturing have been solved we re trying to take our silicon competency in manufacturing and apply it to new areas said dr paniccia while work has been done to make some of the components that can move light around before now silicon has not successfully been used to generate or amplify the laser light pulses used to send data over long distances this is despite the fact that silicon is a much better amplifier of light pulses than the form of the material used in fibre optic cables this improved amplification is due to the crystalline structure of the silicon used to make computer chips dr paniccia said that the structure of silicon meant that when laser light passed through it some colliding photons rip electrons off the atoms within the material it creates a cloud of electrons sitting in the silicon and that absorbs all the light he said but the intel researchers have found a way to suck away these errant electrons and turn silicon into a material that can both generate and amplify laser light even better the laser light produced in this way can with the help of easy to make filters be tuned across a very wide range of frequencies semi conductor lasers made before now have only produced light in a narrow frequency ranges the result could be the close integration of the fibre optic cables that carry data as light with the computer chips that process it dr paniccia said the work was the one of several steps needed if silicon was to be used to make components that could carry and process light in the form of data pulses it s a technical validation that it can work he said

0,nuclear body seeks new tech the computer systems used to monitor the world s nuclear power installations are so outdated that they are hampering the work of inspectors a spokesman for the international atomic energy agency iaea said its current technology could allow key information to be overlooked as it was more than 20 years old such systems are the only method of tracking nuclear material worldwide the agency has appealed for more funds to update its hardware and software a major overhaul of the system is needed to allow inspectors immediate secure online access to information said project manager livio costantini iaea inspectors make around 3 000 visits a year to more than 900 nuclear facilities worldwide they are there to verify official reports of activities in the plants to carry out environmental checks and also to look for any signs that nuclear material is being smuggled in or out of the facility the computer system inspectors currently use for comparing data from earlier visits for instance was built in the 1970s and largely paper based an iaea spokesman said this was extremely inefficient and makes searching for anomalies like searching for a needle in a haystack the organisation is aiming to start a system upgrade in november aiming to provide inspectors in the field with secure online access to previous inspection data design blueprints of nuclear facilities even satellite images of the plant where possible it hopes to link the system with national records of the import and export of nuclear materials further analysis of these could help spot potential smuggling activities or illicit technology transfers between countries according to a spokesman computer specialist at the iaea peter smith would like to be able to incorporate state of the art visualisation techniques more familiar to video games players into the inspector s toolkit the commercials you now see have people are moving around in a virtual world he said if we could have that on our laptops we could be walking through the plant seeing on the laptop how the plant should look and if there s a door in the wall that is not on our laptop then we have a problem the iaea estimates the total cost of the four year project to upgrade its technology will be 40m so far it has only received 11m from the us and the uk failure to replace the hardware and software and to integrate fully all the information system components will carry large risks said an agency statement

4,blair looks to election campaign tony blair s big speech will be looked back on as the performance that kicked off the election campaign that poll may still be about 16 weeks away but there can be little doubt left that the campaign is now in full swing the prime minister used his speech to a selected audience in the south east to set out his broad brush election manifesto there was a detailed account of the government s past record with a major emphasis on the economy and public services there was an attempt to draw the line under the gossip surrounding his rift with chancellor gordon brown and there was an insistence on the importance of the party continuing to operate as unremittingly new labour although that may continue to irritate his chancellor there was little in terms of concrete proposals or what might form manifesto pledges although the prime minister talked about a new labour manifesto that will be aimed at all sections of society his was more a speech designed to remind people and some in his own party precisely what new labour stood for and to leave them in no doubt there would not be any shrinking away from that approach and for some that means showing that new labour actually does stand for something that it is as he said more than an electoral device to that end he set out a broad programme aimed to appeal to both middle england voters who switched to the party in 1997 and stuck with it possibly through some gritted teeth in 2001 and to more traditional lower income old labour supporters in a key section he declared in our third term we can achieve an unprecedented widening of opportunity and prosperity for the first time ever a whole generation growing up with unbroken economic stability every family not just the fortunate few knowing their children will have an inheritance at adulthood every pupil in every secondary school guaranteed a place in university or a quality apprenticeship every adult including those who missed out at school able to get the skills then need to advance home ownership extended to its highest ever level and to families who have never before been able to afford it the highest ever level of employment with everyone in work guaranteed a decent wage and decent conditions under what is to be the general election slogan britain is working the prime minister time and again insisted the future direction would be unremittingly new labour that might get under the skin of mr brown but he also heaped praise on him as the most successful post war chancellor britain has had probably the greatest ideological divide between the two men in so far as there is one is about the degree of private finance allowed into the public services an unremittingly new labour manifesto as the prime minister is happy to make plain will stress the importance of that the belief patients and parents for example want a choice of good services before they start worrying about who has provided them the chancellor is said to be far more sceptical about private finance although there is no suggestion he opposes it in principle with an election looming the next big speech from gordon brown will be closely examined for any signs of divisions and in particular the use of that little three letter word but for now all eyes have been focused on the next general election and for many in westminster mr blair s performance has only succeeded in hardening the belief that will be on 5 may

4,labour s core support takes stock tony blair has told labour supporters he s back and still hungry for the job of prime minister but does that sum up the mood at the party s spring conference in gateshead the electorate are keener on the government than some labour party members is the dry assessment of graham lane leader of the labour group on newham council the problem according to mr lane is not continuing divisions over iraq foundation hospitals or tuition fees or even voter apathy but mr blair himself i have a new slogan vote blair get brown that s what i am telling people on the doorstep don t worry he will be gone soon his friend saxon spence leader of devon county labour group lays the blame for any lack of campaigning zeal on one issue above all others you cannot underestimate the impact of the war in iraq we lost people from our local party who had some key roles but the two friends were fired up by gordon brown s speech on saturday with its appeal to core labour values on social justice health and education there was real passion i think we have all felt a little jaded but it reminded us why we joined the party in the first place said mrs spence if he hadn t have walked off the stage they would still be clapping added mr lane but for every brownite at the spring conference there was an equally ardent fan of mr blair stephen douglas 26 from wales said after the pm s speech on sunday i think it was a bit of a turning point given the roasting he has had on some issues the guy still has it tony martin of burnley said he is the first leader who has won us two terms this bloke has delivered for us malcolm shipley of shipley said it was as if he is coming round to the right approach again katrina bull a prospective parliamentary candidate said mr blair had shown he could rouse the party s grassroots i think if every voter was able to spend time in a room with tony the way we have today we will have no problem with turnout she had just emerged from a q a session in which mr blair tieless and supremely at ease answered questions posed via the party s website a party of councillors from nottingham agreed that there was nothing wrong with mr blair s leadership and they were adamant that the campaigning strength of the party in their city was as strong as ever iraq they insisted would not be a factor for most voters the biggest problem we have got at the moment is that we keep getting all these polls saying we are going to run away with the election it might sound great but it does create this sense of complacency among our own voters and i think that is the greater problem than iraq said nottingham city councillor brian parbutt and even mr blair s most vocal critics seemed to agree on one thing he is a master of the sort of glossy high profile campaigning that has become labour s hallmark epitomised by friday s whistle stop tour of marginal seats a group of shop stewards from the swan hunter shipyard who said they were facing redundancy could barely suppress their anger at mr blair s failure to as they saw it shake off his tory leanings and stand up for manufacturing in the north east they were also scathing about the alleged benefits of showpiece projects such as conference venue sage centre heralded by john prescott and others this weekend as a symbol of labour s success in urban regeneration it is no good having the sage or baltic if you haven t got the money for the entrance fee said terry telford but when asked about mr blair s bravura performance on friday the men agreed he was brilliant and they would all be out on the doorstep pushing the labour message come election time if you are not fired up about the election then what s the point there is no complacency as far as i can see in the labour party we are fired up we are up for this election said richie porterhouse mr telford agreed but added it was becoming increasingly difficult to think of an answer when people asked what has labour done for the north east i have had doors slammed in my face he said every activist i spoke to said they were proud of what they believed labour had achieved in their local communities the new hospitals and schools the better life chances for young people the problem they faced they said was converting this local feelgood factor into votes but they could at least rely on one secret weapon as one activist put it tory leader michael howard

1,cuba winds back economic clock fidel castro s decision to ban all cash transactions in us dollars in cuba has once more turned the spotlight on cuba s ailing economy all conversions between the us dollar and cuba s convertible peso will from 8 november be subject to a 10 tax cuban citizens who receive money from overseas and foreign visitors who change dollars in cuba will be affected critics of the measure argue that it is a step backwards reflecting the cuban president s desire to increase his control of the economy and to clamp down on private enterprise in a live television broadcast announcing the measure president castro s chief aide said it was necessary because of the united states increasing economic aggression the ten percent obligation applies exclusively to the dollar by virtue of the situation created by the new measures of the us government to suffocate our country he said the bush administration has taken an increasingly harsh line on cuba in recent months president bush s government which has been a strong supporter of the 40 year old trade embargo on cuba introduced even tighter restrictions on cuba in may cubans living in the us are now limited to one visit to cuba every three years and they can only send money to their immediate relatives a leading expert on the cuban economy says that castro s tax plan smacks more of a desperate economic measure than a political gesture i think it is primarily an effort to raise some cash says jose barrionuevo head of strategy for latin american emerging markets for barclays capital it underscores the fact that the economy is in very bad shape and the government is looking for sources of revenue the tax will hit the families of cuban exiles hardest as they benefit from the money their displaced relatives send home this money known as remittances can amount to as much as 1bn a year those remaining in cuba will have to pay the tax their relatives abroad may choose to send money in other currencies which are not subject to the tax such as euros or increase their dollar payments to compensate however many of cuban s poorest citizens could be worse off as a result the tax will also affect the two million tourists who visit cuba every year particularly those americans who continue to defy a ban on travel there cuba s tourist industry has been one of its few economic success stories over the last ten years and according to the un economic commission for latin america is now worth 3bn to the country the tax is designed to provide much needed revenue for cuba s cash strapped economy cuba badly needs dollars to pay for essential items such as food fuel and medicine much of cuba s basic infrastructure is in a state of disrepair in recent weeks cuba has suffered its most serious power cuts in a decade and there have also been water shortages in parts of the island cuba s economy had staged a modest recovery during the mid 1990s as the collapse of the soviet union forced it to embrace foreign capital decentralise trade and permit limited private enterprise however a decline in foreign tourism since 2002 periodic hurricanes and the increasing costs of importing oil have put a strain on the economy it has however yet to be seen if the tax will provide a solution to the government s economic problems the tax could fuel an active black market in currency trading mr barrionuevo said the main impact could be that it will create a black market which you typically see in countries like venezuela which have restrictions on capital he says mr barrioneuvo says the measure could be dropped if it has a damaging effect on economic activity it is intended to be a permanent measure but i am not sure it can last too long
4,concerns at school diploma plan final appeals are being made for the government not to ditch the reform plan for england s secondary schools put forward by the tomlinson report the government s response to the plan for a four tier diploma to replace all existing 14 19 qualifications is expected next week some are worried it could be scuppered if as tony blair and ruth kelly have suggested gcses and a levels stay sir mike tomlinson himself was briefed only this week he is said to be feeling more comfortable about what the government is likely to say than if he had read only what was in newspapers in the earlier part of the week but the government was said to be still rewriting its response on friday it will be a tragedy if the government comes through with a half hearted response said the chairman of the commons education select committee labour mp barry sheerman his main concern was the reports that there would be a diploma but only to replace existing vocational qualifications we must tackle head on the structural mess that is our secondary education system he wrote in the times educational supplement it is not the case that the academic stream in secondary is fine while the vocational route is desperately weak the qualifications and curriculum authority qca has also told the government not to compromise the qca said the potential step change in participation and attainment lay in the integrity of the whole diploma any partial implementation of the proposals would in our view compromise that integrity said its chairman sir anthony greener it is a sign of the qca s concern that its advice went to ministers last december but was publicised only recently but people understand that a white paper response is government policy and has to command wider ministerial support than if it were coming only from the department for education and skills they may be content if it does not close too many doors in writing whatever spin is put on it the chief inspector of schools david bell also said recently that gcses and a levels should go one of the reasons why i m so strongly in favour of these terms disappearing over time is that it s good for the symbols of change to be seen right across the system he said if we don t say this is a sea change in education we will miss a great opportunity universities and head teachers in both the independent and state sectors have also backed the tomlinson proposals which include having higher grades at advanced level to differentiate between the brightest students a note of concern has been expressed repeatedly by the employers organisation the cbi which complains of a lack of skills in an attempt to address this the tomlinson plan is for tests in functional maths and literacy decidedly not gcses it has been suggested the government will take steps of some sort to meet firms concerns on this score another dissenter is sir mike tomlinson s predecessor as chief schools inspector professor chris woodhead who has said there is no need for such a massive upheaval the conservative party has put forward plans to revert to a system of having only the brightest percentage of students each year getting the top a level grade no matter how well the others have done

2,o sullivan keeps his powder dry when you are gunning for glory and ultimate success keeping the gunpowder dry is essential ireland coach eddie o sullivan appears to have done that quite successfully in the run up to this season s six nations championship he decreed after the 2003 world cup that players should have a decent conditioning period during the year that became a reality at the end of last summer with a 10 week period at the start of the this season it may have annoyed his scottish and in particularly welsh cousins who huffed and puffed at the disrespect apparently shown to the celtic league we will say nothing of mike ruddock poaching eight of the dragons side that faced leinster on sunday but like o sullivan he was well within his rights particularly when you are talking about the national side and pride that goes along with it the irfu has thrown their weight behind o sullivan who must be glad that in the main there is centrally controlled contracts bar keith gleeson who is just returning from a broken leg everyone of o sullivan s squad is fit fresh and standing at the oche ready to launch this season s campaign but i doubt whether o sullivan is going to gloat about the handling of his players he is not that sort of person however he may look at the overworked and injury hit england wales and france squads whose players have been overworked and then pat himself on the back for his foresight but there is still the question of turning up and transferring that freshness into positive results when the referee signals the start of the game already ireland are being earmarked as hot favourites in many quarters to go the whole hog this season a first grand slam since karl mullen s led the team to a clean sweep in 1948 with england and france visiting lansdowne road for the last time before the old darling is pulled down everything looks perfectly placed but in the days of yore that frightened the life out of any irishman under the burden of great expectations ireland have crumpled take the triple crown winning side of 1985 under mick doyle they were expected to up the ante further for a grand slam only the second in ireland s history what happened in 1986 whitewashed you see ireland in any sport love to be downsized then they can go out and prove a point to the contrary it is the nature of the beast but o sullivan s side are very capable of proving a salient point this season after their first triple crown for 19 years they can live up to their success and take a further step up the ladder o sullivan has kept faith and displayed loyalty to his players and they have repaid him in spades and there is more to come he has some old dogs in his squad but he will come to this season s championship with a different box of tricks and a new verve to succeed ireland can indeed succeed but just whisper it
4,sport betting rules in spotlight a group of mps and peers has called for a tightening of regulations controlling betting on sport the parliamentary group on betting and gaming held a substantial inquiry into betting last year it followed fears that a massive increase in betting on sport such as that done using the internet and mobile phones has led to more cheating the all party group recommended 15 ways to protect punters and improve the integrity of sports betting they include a proposal for raising the maximum jail sentence for gambling cheats above the current two years lord condon head of the international cricket council s anti corruption unit who originally made the call for longer prison sentences said the two year penalty was derisory you could get a bigger sentence for failing to pay your hotel bill criminally than you could for corruption in major sports symbolically a higher penalty perhaps as the bill passes through the two houses might be appropriate the report recommended the governing bodies of sports have a say in the type of bets offered to punters and for bookmakers to set up audit trails something the new betting exchanges already do to allow suspicious betting patterns to be traced lord faulkner of worcester who chaired the inquiry said whilst we accept that the greater part of sports betting is neither corrupt nor unfair to punters the evidence convinces us that the growth of betting exchanges because of the facility they provide to bet against a result has increased the potential for corruption it is important that the government works with sporting administrators to review the difficulties faced by governing bodies in convicting the guilty and penalising them appropriately the panel s aim was to try to define what constitutes cheating assess how much might be going on and suggest what the government might do to put it right as well as the growth of internet and mobile phone betting there has been the creation of betting exchanges which allow punters to fix odds between themselves betting exchanges allow punters to back to win but also lay to lose a horse this means they can control their odds at winning by placing their money both ways
0,brainwave cap controls computer a team of us researchers has shown that controlling devices with the brain is a step closer four people two of them partly paralysed wheelchair users successfully moved a computer cursor while wearing a cap with 64 electrodes previous research has shown that monkeys can control a computer with electrodes implanted into their brain the new york team reported their findings in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences the results show that people can learn to use scalp recorded electroencephalogram rhythms to control rapid and accurate movement of a cursor in two directions said jonathan wolpaw and dennis mcfarlane the research team from new york state department of health and state university of new york in albany said the research was another step towards people controlling wheelchairs or other electronic devices by thought the four people faced a large video screen wearing a special cap which meant no surgery or implantation was needed brain activity produces electrical signals that can be read by electrodes complex algorithms then translate those signals into instructions to direct the computer such brain activity does not require the use of any nerves of muscles so people with stroke or spinal cord injuries could use the cap effectively the impressive non invasive multidimensional control achieved in the present study suggests that a non invasive brain control interface could support clinically useful operation of a robotic arm a motorised wheelchair or a neuroprosthesis said the researchers the four volunteers also showed that they could get better at controlling the cursor the more times they tried although the two partially paralysed people performed better overall the researchers said this could be because their brains were more used to adapting or that they were simply more motivated it is not the first time researchers have had this sort of success in brain control experiments some teams have used eye motion and other recording techniques earlier this year a team at the mit media labs europe demonstrated a wireless cap which read brain waves to control a computer character

4,anglers could face prosecution anglers and fishermen could find themselves prosecuted under plans to crack down on animal cruelty a committee of mps has warned sloppy wording of the draft animal welfare bill could leave anglers facing court even though it was not intended the environment select committee said the mps said they were concerned the government had not consulted directly on its plans to improve animal welfare they raised complex and emotive issues which needed to be resolved mps said they called for a cast iron guarantee that the government consults on any plans to regulate animal industries like pet fairs and game bird rearing the draft bill seeks to modernise and improve animal welfare legislation and intends to protect kept animals and companion animals by setting up a duty of care in addition to maintaining existing cruelty offences it creates an offence of neglect by keepers who fail to protect the animals for whom they are responsible the bill would allow animal welfare officers to intervene to prevent harm to an animal as well as outlawing mutilation of animals unless it can be demonstrated to be in the animal s best interest the environment select committee made 101 recommendations after hearing evidence from 51 organisations and individuals one was a call to amend the bill so that prosecutions against those engaged in fishing were not inadvertently encouraged even if they were to later fail we accept that neither commercial fishing nor recreational angling should fall within the remit of the of the draft bill and we therefore support the government s intention to exempt fishing as an activity but the committee said an amendment was needed to ensure cases were not brought however in exempting fishing the government should be careful to ensure that those persons who catch fish are not given carte blanche to inflict unnecessary suffering in the course of pursuing this activity the committee added the committee also said some legal protections for animals were downgraded by the bill such as the law on abandonment of animals which would be significantly weakened mps urged the government to redraft clauses relating to the prosecution of cruelty offences this was because as it stood the draft bill would allow certain acts that should be prosecuted such as unnecessary suffering caused to an animal through neglect or unnecessary mental suffering to go unpunished committee chairman michael jack said any change in the law as it affects animals always arouses powerful emotions and great public interest this draft bill is no exception my committee welcomes the development of an approach to animal welfare which doesn t just wait for a problem to occur but enables action to be taken to protect animals before irreversible suffering takes place but mr jack said the bill very much had the feel of a work in progress and urged the government to guarantee that an obligation to consult will be enshrined in law before it extended legislative plans to areas such as pet fairs circuses and game bird farms the government must work hard to take the rough edges of its initial proposals before the bill is introduced to parliament he added

2,european medal chances improve what have the european indoor trials told us well i think we could be heading to the european championships with half a dozen medal prospects it was good to see athletes beginning to make steps forward to see a few new faces and there were lots of personal bests kicking around the best performance on the track for me was sarah claxton s win in the 60m hurdles running sub eight seconds twice in a week puts her right up there and if she repeats that in madrid she will be close to picking up a medal but what was great about sunday s performance was that she was under pressure to produce the goods when it counted diane allahgreen has been our best hurdler for some time now and i think she was surprised to be beaten by sarah and knowing that she got the better of diane in a head to head race will give sarah confidence in the men s race on saturday allan scott was right in there and there is definitely more to come from him in fact the men s 60m hurdles is so strong i think the selectors will pick three hurdlers to go to madrid phillips idowu lit up the field events not only with his hair but also with his leap of 17 30m which puts him at the top of the world rankings i had a chat with him before the competition and he was really looking forward to getting out there he feels he is in great shape and has some big jumps inside him but then phillips always has a lot of the athletes said the runway was not very helpful so for phillips to jump like that is a good performance he is such a huge talent but just needs some consistency and if he does that then the big jumps will get even further across the board i thought kelly sotherton had a great weekend and continued to show she is developing she picked up three personal bests in the long jump high jump and 60m hurdles and you can t ask for more than that kelly will be up against carolina kluft in the pentathlon at the european championships but she has every chance of a medal on the basis of what we ve seen so far she has a complicated training regime where different people help her with different disciplines but it seems to be working really well it wasn t all good news in sheffield i thought both the 60m races were disappointing in different ways jason gardener may have won but he wasn t at his best i chatted to him afterwards and he knows it was an off day for him he s there to be shot at and the other lads nearly got a big scalp out there in the women s race jeanette kwayke was hoping to run against defending champion joice maduaka the pair are enjoying a bit of rivalry but joice had to pull out with a chest infection if she had made the final i think jeanette would have gone a bit quicker janine whitlock competed well in the pole vault on her return following a two year drugs ban but the most disappointing thing in the wider view is that she is our best pole vaulter by a long way and that shouldn t be the case the event has moved on immensely since janine has been away and if there was more domestic competition i think that would help her a couple of other interesting topics to look out for are the citizenship issues surrounding mark findlay and rabah yusuf findlay is a londoner who has chosen to represent trinidad and tobago but has never run for them so he could still compete for great britain yusuf who came third in the 400m is from the sudan but is trying to gain british citizenship he came to britain as a high jumper but damaged his toe started doing more running and found his talent so we shall have to see what happens to both of them

3,redford s vision of sundance despite sporting a corduroy cap pulled low over his face plus a pair of dark glasses robert redford cuts an unmistakable figure through the star struck crowds at sundance it s a rare downtown appearance for the man who started the annual festival in park city utah back in the 1980s now in its twenty first year sundance continues to grow some 45 000 people are estimated to have descended on this small ski town with nothing but movies on the mind it s an opportunity to meet and make deals redford wanted sundance to be a platform for independent film makers but the commercial success of many showcased films have led to criticism that the festival is becoming too mainstream smaller festivals like slamdance and xdance which take place during the same week in park city are competing for sundance s limelight but redford is not worried the more the merrier he says the point was to create opportunities for people who may not have them once independent film had a place where the work could be seen suddenly the merchants came with them the celebrities came then the paparazzi and suddenly it began to take on a whole new tone explains redford people started to say we had gone mainstream and hollywood but actually hollywood came to us because suddenly there was good business in independent film he adds international film makers have always been celebrated here but 2005 is the first year a dedicated world dramatic and documentary competition is being held redford wants the festival to encompass viewpoints he believes the american media fails to reflect particularly how the us is perceived internationally he has never hidden the fact that he is a democrat but he reserves particular disdain for the current republican administration it s the ability to maintain the importance of dissent in a democratic system which right now is under threat with the attitude of this administration he says i think many voices are being shut down or accused of being unpatriotic if they want to express another point of view that s very unhealthy and very dangerous if we take that policy into the world there will be the same victims and the same consequences sundance isn t just one big screening there are discussion panels and q a sessions with directors tackling controversial topics like america s culture wars and the iraq war while redford wishes the festival to be a forum for dissent the profile of the audience is fairly monolithic educated middle class and predominantly white americans comes sundance with views from the same end of the political spectrum anti war and socially liberal but redford knows this and started the sundance tv channel in an effort to reach a wider audience when you look at the films here what we are presenting is very much egalitarian and it s about good films and good story telling be it african america asian women gay lesbian sooner or later we will do away with those stereotypical labels and people will say it s just a film by so and so

4,blair ready to call election tony blair seems certain to end weeks of phoney war on monday and announce there will be a general election on 5 may the date has been pencilled into the diaries of politicians and political journalists for many months and despite occasional panics that the prime minister was on the verge of calling a snap poll it has not shifted over the weeks there have been any number of signs that 050505 was going to be the day mr blair would go for an historic third term and the calling of a special political cabinet meeting has only added to the belief that the announcement is imminent the prime minister and his campaign boss alan milburn have already insisted the election will be fought on the economy and what they claim is a stark choice between labour s stability and investment against tory cuts and boom and bust and chancellor gordon brown has stepped into the front line of the campaign to the relief of many of his supporters in westminster to underline that economic message and it is certain one of the big arguments at the centre of the election battle will be around the big parties tax and spend policies during the phoney campaign labour got into trouble over its central claim that michael howard was planning 35 bn cuts in public services the prime minister found himself struggling to explain how a smaller slower increase in spending planned by the tories compared to labour s plans was a cut and it looked like the labour campaign which was already being criticised for being thrown into defensive mode by mr howard on issues such as immigration and health was on the rocks then deputy conservative chairman howard flight was reported to have suggested mr howard was secretly planning even bigger cuts he was sacked for his gaffe but the damage had been done and the faltering labour campaign was back on track a second central argument will be over taxation with the tories claiming the chancellor has to fill a black hole at the centre of his finances and will be forced to raise taxes if labour wins again mr brown slaps that aside claiming his forecasts are accurate and that previous claims of looming economic disaster have proved inaccurate as usual the liberal democrats will have to fight to get their voice heard over the sounds of battle between the two big parties but leader charles kennedy believes he has set out a distinctive manifesto with plans for a tax rise for the wealthiest to finance extra spending and the abolition of the council tax in favour of a local income tax other issues are certain to play a part immigration and asylum the war on iraq law and order and education for example but as ever it will be the economy that will almost certainly decide the outcome and whatever that outcome 2005 is set to be a far more lively even bitter campaign than 2001 s non event

4,election deal faltered over heath role the tories failed to hold onto power in 1974 after liberals demanded sir edward heath quit in return for co operation documents released after 30 years reveal the failed negotiations by the then prime minister following the dramatic february general election liberal leader jeremy thorpe appeared willing to form a coalition government but it partly collapsed over the conservative leader s own role prompting the queen to ask harold wilson to form a labour government the february 1974 general election surprised the nation when it created a hung parliament with no party in overall control sir edward had gone to the country for a fresh mandate amid the spiralling economic crisis a miners strike and the subsequent three day week labour emerged with the most seats but its 301 mps were 17 short of the number mr wilson needed to form a majority sir edward who had received more votes but had fewer mps believed he had the authority to remain at number 10 providing the 14 liberal mps would support his government he said the liberals could keep out labour in three ways lend ad hoc support to his minority government help draw up the government s programme or have up to three cabinet members in a coalition with the conservatives according to the documents released at the national archives the friendly and easy first meeting indicated that both sir edward and mr thorpe thought they had the makings of a deal mr thorpe was in high spirits having just led his party to a historic jump in support he also argued for a grand coalition of all three main parties but sir edward said that was impossible because the labour left was set against it and the pair settled on trying for a conservative liberal pact hours later sir edward s hopes of a deal unravelled as mr thorpe s colleagues refused to support him jeremy said he was encountering a rather embarrassing problem with his colleagues about the prime minister personally reads a telephone memo for mr heath they feel they could not agree to serve as long as he is the prime minister asked if this was his own view he said no it was not i am very close to ted and thought he was by far the most able man we had and he would be perfectly happy to serve it was only some of his colleagues who were being difficult the following day the stickling points had clearly become two fold mr thorpe s colleagues wanted electoral reform and sir edward s resignation mr thorpe told sir edward i am sorry this is obviously hell a nightmare on stilts for you somehow i personally hope that we can work something out four hours later sir edward called the liberal leader back to downing street in a last attempt at a deal the minutes of the meeting show how the chance of a coalition government quickly evaporated the pm said he was bound to tell mr thorpe that his colleagues had told him that they would not agree to serve under any other prime minister mr thorpe was at liberty to verify this by talking to one or two of the prime minister s colleagues documents show that sir edward mulled over resigning and perhaps returning to coalition government in a labour led coalition but he already knew mr wilson would not form a coalition with either the liberals or the conservatives because of the opposition of the labour left within hours of his final talks with mr thorpe sir edward told the nation he was resigning and the queen invited mr wilson to form a new minority government

2,parry firm over gerrard listen to the full interview on sport on five and the bbc sport website from 1900 gmt but parry speaking exclusively to bbc sport also admits gerrard who has been constantly linked with chelsea will have the final say on his future he told bbc five live steven is above money he is the future of liverpool it doesn t matter if it s 30m 40m or 50m we will not accept offers but we are also realistic enough to know we can t keep steven against his will on the subject of liverpool s finances parry also revealed the club is ready to explore the possibility of a sponsorship deal for its proposed new stadium and responding to criticism from bbc sport pundit and former liverpool stalwart alan hansen he insisted talks on new investment are ongoing but added the door has not closed on shareholder and lifelong fan steve morgan parry joined liverpool as chief executive in july 1998 from a similar role at the premier league there have been several highs and lows during his time in charge at anfield and he had a busy summer overseeing the arrival of new manager rafael benitez and managing to hold on to steven gerrard on the subject of liverpool s captain and prize asset parry revealed real madrid did ask for an option on the england midfield man during negotiations for striker fernando morientes he said they were looking for ways of saying they got more out of the deal for fernando morientes but the response to real madrid was the same steven is not for sale but when asked if gerrard would be a liverpool player on the first day of next season parry said i sincerely hope he will be steven knows my views he knows rafa s views we have re affirmed recently to steven that we are trying to build a team around him we crave success as much as he does we know he s ambitious and nobody can argue with that i think steven would dearly love to win things with liverpool more than he d like to do anything else we all want to see progress by next season he s not alone in that there are a lot of other players who feel the same so we all have a common aim it is expected chelsea will test liverpool with a 30m plus bid in the summer but parry claims he will be in no mood to listen there have been a lot of open secrets about steven most of which have been complete myths it is suggested we had a deal tied up last summer we didn t had an offer last summer parry explained we had told chelsea that as far as we were concerned he was not for sale and we didn t want to sell him in reality it didn t go beyond that maybe there will be an offer in the summer maybe there won t our position is we want steven to stay but we are also realistic enough and have enough respect for steven and he has enough respect for us to know that it is his decision that will be crucial you are not going to keep a player like steven against his will that just doesn t work but any idea we are going to accept offers for steven and then tell him by the way we ve decided to sell you is not on the agenda you can forget that parry is currently in the process of finalising funding for liverpool s new stadium in stanley park which is set to open in 2007 and he confessed arsenal s 100m deal with emirates to sponsor their new ground complete with naming rights has given the anfield club serious food for thought he said i have to say historically it is something i have been against and i have been on record as saying that but i think the size of the arsenal deal is a real eye opener i would say in the past deals have been done frankly far too cheaply and it just hasn t even been worth contemplating but the arsenal deal is the sort of deal that causes you to draw breath and say wow that s interesting my personal point of view is that i would find it a hell of a lot more palatable than a shared stadium some liverpool fans would find such a move highly controversial but parry countered i recognise it would be an emotive issue for many supporters but you look at the amount of money available and it could go into the team if it was the right partner how strong an issue is it time will tell i think the stadium will always be anfield not least because of where it is but do we need to investigate the possibilities of sponsorship i think it would be remiss not to that s not to say we have made a decision that we will go down that road but i think it is clearly something we have to explore on the subject of possible new investment parry revealed liverpool are still in negotiations with a mystery investor with rumours of interest from the middle east that prompted the withdrawal of tycoon steve morgan who got frustrated by failed bids and what he claimed was indecision by the board he also accused liverpool of using him as a stalking horse to attract other bids but parry explained steve has never been used as a stalking horse there s no need and that is not the way we do business we had discussions with steve over the course of 2004 i think we came close to concluding a deal in the summer but it didn t happen quite genuinely the new interest did appear relatively late in the day just prior to the agm in december and as i have said it was of such potential magnitude and that potential is so exciting we felt we had to evaluate it we are still evaluating it steve s interest was taken very much on its own merits his enthusiasm for the club is there for all to see and who knows what the next few months will hold the door isn t closed on anything we had a perfectly sensible dialogue with steve last year we have a common interest in making liverpool successful that s a dream we all share so as far as i m concerned the door is not closed i would take 50m if we had no investment but if we did keep him as for the stadium if it gets us cash what difference does it make really 50m for gerrard i don t care who you are the directors would take the money and it is the way it should be we cannot let that sum of money go despite gerrard s quality through a cleverly worded statement the club has effectively forced gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself which i think is the right thing to do critical time for liverpool with regards to gerrard ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term i am hoping he doesn t walk out of the club like michael owen did for very little cash 50m realistically would allow rafa to completely rebuild the squad however if we can afford to do this and keep gerrard we will be better for it i would however be happy with gerrard s transfer for any fee over 35m parry s statements are clever in that any future gerrard transfer cannot be construed as a lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players upping the ante is another smart move by parry i would keep gerrard no amount of money could replace his obvious love of the club and determination to succeed the key is if gerrard comes out and says that he is happy clearly if he isn t then we would be foolish not to sell the worrying thing is who would you buy or who would come pending possible non champions league football
