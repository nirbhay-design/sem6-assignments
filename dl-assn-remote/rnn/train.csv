1,dollar gains on greenspan speech the dollar has hit its highest level against the euro in almost three months after the federal reserve head said the us trade deficit is set to stabilise and alan greenspan highlighted the us government s willingness to curb spending and rising household savings as factors which may help to reduce it in late trading in new york the dollar reached 1 2871 against the euro from 1 2974 on thursday market concerns about the deficit has hit the greenback in recent months on friday federal reserve chairman mr greenspan s speech in london ahead of the meeting of g7 finance ministers sent the dollar higher after it had earlier tumbled on the back of worse than expected us jobs data i think the chairman s taking a much more sanguine view on the current account deficit than he s taken for some time said robert sinche head of currency strategy at bank of america in new york he s taking a longer term view laying out a set of conditions under which the current account deficit can improve this year and next worries about the deficit concerns about china do however remain china s currency remains pegged to the dollar and the us currency s sharp falls in recent months have therefore made chinese export prices highly competitive but calls for a shift in beijing s policy have fallen on deaf ears despite recent comments in a major chinese newspaper that the time is ripe for a loosening of the peg the g7 meeting is thought unlikely to produce any meaningful movement in chinese policy in the meantime the us federal reserve s decision on 2 february to boost interest rates by a quarter of a point the sixth such move in as many months has opened up a differential with european rates the half point window some believe could be enough to keep us assets looking more attractive and could help prop up the dollar the recent falls have partly been the result of big budget deficits as well as the us s yawning current account gap both of which need to be funded by the buying of us bonds and assets by foreign firms and governments the white house will announce its budget on monday and many commentators believe the deficit will remain at close to half a trillion dollars

4,councils prepare to set tax rises council tax in scotland is set to rise by an average of about 4 in the coming year bbc scotland has learned authorities will decide final figures on thursday when projected increases will be more than twice the rate of inflation which is currently 1 6 the finance minister has urged councils to limit increases but they have warned that they will struggle to maintain services unless funding is increased they say much additional government money is for new initiatives scottish finance minister tom mccabe msp said last week in parliament i announced an additional 419m for core expenditure to local government in scotland that s a 5 5 increase and sits against an inflation rate of 1 6 so i think we have quite rightly said to councils this year that we would at the very least ask them to exercise restraint mr mccabe is also looking for local authorities to become more efficient and save money in coming years he told bbc radio scotland s sunday live programme here in scotland we have 32 councils who all have their own individual collection systems for council tax they have their own payroll systems and their own human resource systems we think there has to be opportunities there for rationalisation and using the money saved to reinvest in frontline services the councils umbrella organisation cosla which provided bbc scotland with the indicative figures for next year warned that councils would face a continuous struggle to maintain services mr mccabe has promised them about 8 1bn next year however most of the increase is targeted to new initiatives and councils will experience difficulties in maintaining core services a cosla spokesman said cosla says that it is willing to work with the executive on finding efficiency savings but that these will not be enough to maintain services they say the funding plans for the next three years will see councils lose more of the share of public spending the conservatives accuse the scottish executive of using the council tax to raise funds because it is too afraid to raise income tax the tory finance spokesman brian monteith msp said its a form of disguise yet again we see that council tax is being used as a way of passing on costs scared of actually using its three pence income tax that it could put up what we ve seen over the years is more and more burdens being put onto local authorities and the council tax payer having to pick up the bill there are also warnings that unless funding to councils is increased in the next few years then services may have to be reduced linda knox director of the scottish local authority management centre at strathclyde university said with this current settlement the increase is slowing at the same time the burdens on councils are greater than they were the settlement figures don t include pay increases and the executive is also requiring a substantial figure in the area of 325m in efficiency savings across the settlement period education will be protected from any cuts but linda knox says this will mean other services will suffer she said in practice that will mean a 4 5 cut for other services on the face of it the settlement looks like an increase of about 9 7 but by the time you take into account other factors its probably only about 1 in real terms
2,benitez delight after crucial win liverpool manager rafael benitez admitted victory against deportivo la coruna was vital in their tight champions league group jorge andrade s early own goal gave liverpool a 1 0 win and benitez said we started at a very high tempo and had many chances it is a very important win for us and we could have scored more goals we were very good defensively and also good on the counter attack we are pleased but move on to the next game igor biscan was outstanding in midfield after replacing injured xabi alonso and benitez said he played very well it is important to have all the players ready and a good squad so you can play more games at a high level benitez added it is all back in our own hands now it was a great win for us and i was delighted with what i feel was the best liverpool i have seen as far as my feelings about winning in spain that is really not important i want to see us win away matches in the champions league that it was in spain was not my first consideration as far as i am concerned it is important for liverpool to win it is not important in what country it is in benitez added benitez said we had a problem before the start it was decided that xabi could not play more than 45 minutes but in the end because of the way that dietmar hamann and igor biscan performed we did not need to change things until right at the end of the match depor are a good team and if you allow them to keep possession they can be very dangerous indeed but we knew that if we hit them on the counter attack it would make them nervous and that is how it worked out deportivo coach javier irureta said liverpool played very well and we just could not break them down i know we have now gone six games at home in europe without scoring but that does not reflect our overall performances but this time we did not play well and we lacked imagination the goal was a bad mistake and a big blow to our confidence players who usually want the ball at that stage did not want it i know we are bottom of the group but as long as there is hope of qualifying we will hang on to that
0,games help you learn and play god games in which players must control virtual people and societies could be educational says research a us researcher has suggested that games such as the sims could be a good way to teach languages ravi purushotma believes that the world of the sims can do a better job of teaching vocabulary and grammar than traditional methods the inherent fun of game playing could help to make learning languages much less of a chore said mr purushotma there must be few parents or teachers that do not worry that the lure of a video game on a computer or console is hard to resist by children that really should be doing their homework but instead of fearing computer games ravi purushotma believes that educationalists particularly language teachers should embrace games one goal would be to break what i believe to be the false assumption that learning and play are inherently oppositional he said he believes that the phenomenal ability of games such as the sims and others to capture the interest of adolescent audiences is ripe for exploitation the hard part of learning any language said mr purushotma were the basic parts of learning what different words refer to and how they are used to build up sentences boring lessons drumming vocabulary into pupils couched in terms they do not understand has made many languages far harder to learn than they should be the way we often teach foreign languages right now is somewhat akin to learning to ride a bike by formally studying gravity he said by contrast said mr purushotma learning via something like the sims may mean students do not feel like they are studying at all this was because the sims does not rely solely on words to get information across to players instead the actions of its computer controlled people and how they interact with their world often makes clear what is going on the incidental information about what a sim was doing could reinforce what a player or student was supposed to be learning said mr purushotma by contrast many language lessons try to impart information about a tongue with little context for instance he said in a version of the sims adapted to teach german if a player misunderstood what was meant by the word energie the actions of a tired sim stumbling then falling asleep would illustrate the meaning if necessary detailed textual information could be called upon to aid players or students understanding one of the drawbacks of the sims said mr purushotma was the lack of spoken language to help people brush up on pronunciation however online versions of the sims in which people have to move in meet the neighbours and get to know the local town could be adapted to help this although not wishing to claim that he is the first to suggest using a game can help people learn mr purushotma believes that educationalists have missed the potential they have to help getting a simulated person to perform everyday activities in a make believe world and having them described in a foreign language could be a powerful learning aid he believes before now he said educational software titles suffer by comparison with the slick graphics and rich worlds found in games but he said using pre prepared game worlds such as the sims has never been easier because tools have been made by its creators and fans that make it easy to modify almost any part of the game this could make it easy for teachers to adapt parts of the game for their own lessons i m hoping now to re create a well polished german learning mod for the sequel by this summer he told the bbc news website i m encouraged to hear that others are thinking of experimenting with japanese and spanish earlier work with a colleague on using civilisation iii to teach students about history showed that it could be a powerful way to get them to realise that solving a society s problems can not always come from making a single change a report on the experiment said students began asking historical and geographical questions in the context of game play using geography and history as tools for their game and drawing inferences about social phenomena based on their play mr purushotma s ideas were aired in an article for the journal language learning and technology
4,mcconnell in drunk remark row scotland s first minister has told a group of high school pupils that it is okay to get drunk once in a while jack mcconnell was speaking to more than 100 secondary pupils from schools in the highlands about the problems of binge drinking and drink promotions he has been criticised by the snp for encouraging young people to get drunk but the scottish executive has insisted mr mcconnell was speaking about adults and his comments were a recognition that people will get drunk the first minister s comments came in a question and answer session at glenurquhart high school in inverness attended by pupils from a number of secondary schools a highland councillor who was at the event has also defended mr mcconnell margaret davidson the independent member for the loch ness west said the first minister was speaking in a very general way and she was sure he was speaking about adults at the time when one pupil asked mr mcconnell how the executive proposed to tackle under age drinking began his response with the quip i m sure there s no under age drinking in the highlands he went on to speak about the evils of binge drinking and railed against irresponsible drinks promotions he said i hope i m not going to be seen as preaching to anybody here but the really serious problem at the moment is binge drinking and the impact it has on people s health and their ability to control what s happening round about them mr mcconnell said he regularly saw reports on the effects of binge drinking sprees which ended in assaults or even rapes and on the health consequences of binge drinking the one thing we are going to do something really serious about is binge drinking and irresponsible drinks promotions that can help lead to that he said far too many pub chains in particular are selling far too much booze far too cheaply and encouraging people to drink it far too quickly we are go to clamp down on that and make those promotions illegal in the hope that people can enjoy a drink sensibly over the course of an evening he added by all means get drunk once in a while but do not get into a situation where people are being encouraged to get completely incapable just to save some money and drink more quickly snp holyrood leader nicola sturgeon said this is an incredible gaffe by jack mcconnell we all know that under age drinking is an issue in scotland but it is quite staggering that any politician particularly the first minister should encourage young people to get drunk the first minister should withdraw these remarks immediately but an executive spokeswoman insisted mr mcconnell had made the remark with adults not youngsters in mind he was talking in the context of adults binge drinking and irresponsible drinks promotions which are for the over 18s she said it was just a recognition that people will get drunk but that binge drinking and drinks promotions that encourage it are not acceptable
0,sporting rivals go to extra time the current slew of sports games offers unparalleled opportunities for fans who like to emulate on field action without ever moving from the couch the two giants in the field espn and ea sports have been locked in a heavyweight battle for years the latter is the world s largest games manufacturer years of experience mean that the titles in their steady flow of sport sims are finely honed massively entertaining and ooze flair sports broadcaster espn meanwhile has leant its name to a series of games that are similarly classy but lower in profile and price but that status quo was changed forever or for the next 15 years at least by a deal earlier this year when espn sold ea the rights to its tv branding and on air talent meaning the espn games presently developed by sega will have to come to and end in their present form it was a massive money deal that not only raised eyebrows but stirred active indignation in many quarters with fans concerned that it is set to enable ea to monopolise the sports gaming landscape to an unhealthy degree some particularly disgruntled fans set up an online petition that notched more than 18 000 virtual signatures many of those clicking to complain were already rankled for the espn coup happened just weeks after ea had pulled off another enormous licensing deal controversially giving them exclusive rights to teams and personnel from america 191 s national football league nfl so will the sega espn range be missed a key reason for answering yes is that liking or disliking a sports game regularly comes down to personal taste and having some options available always proves hugely handy online soccer fans will testify to that between bouts of arguing over which high profile title rules supreme out of the similar yet hugely different fifa 2005 and pro evolution soccer 4 on the same note the espn 2k5 and ea sports games have so little to choose between them that picking favourites will come down to players personal preferences and spending budget rather than any technical elements taking hockey and basketball as examples both publishers efforts are phenomenally entertaining and fairly accessible they also both look awesome with the sega espn versions perhaps shading things on a graphical front in terms of gameplay i marginally preferred ea s nba live 2005 for basketball and was more satisfied ice hockey wise by espn s nhl 2k5 the espn games are a touch more arcade like in look and feel and are slightly easier to get into although like their rivals they also offer a dizzyingly extensive array of in game tricks and overall challenge modes that should be enough to quench thirsts of even the most die hard of sports fans perhaps the most interesting aspect of the espn deal will be seeing how it affects the presentation of ea s future titles the front end decoration of ea s games has become something of an art form in itself loaded with slick visuals and oodles of licensed music they are also immediately identifiable as coming from the ea stable and the inevitable compulsion to add an espn look will no doubt change that in various ways what is a shame is that the espn titles took similar care about framing the gameplay with an authentic setting their preambles look and sound much like they would on tv they are neat and excellent value games in their current form and combining them with ea s own established brand should produce a truly formidable beast

4,labour mps fears over squabbling if there is one thing certain to stiffen the spines of labour mps it is the prospect of losing their seats at a general election and it was largely that fear that led to tony blair and gordon brown being read the riot act during a meeting of the parliamentary labour party the views expressed by both backbenchers and labour peers over the claimed squabbling between the two men starkly demonstrated the widely held view within the labour party that the two most powerful figures in the government are jeopardising the next election as one hugely disgruntled backbencher said before the meeting it is time they realised it s not just my seat they are threatening but if they go on like this they could put the election in doubt it is a sentiment that is now running throughout the labour benches with mps eager to underline the message to their leaders to stop the squabbling and get on with the job at hand as paul flynn said what has deeply upset the party is in this time of all times when we wanted to come together we wanted to lead on the global issues to change politics for the next decade the whole thing was wrecked by a piece of childishness by the two main people in the party two people we greatly respect stephen pound echoed the message saying we know that the one thing that could entirely jeopardise what we are trying to achieve not for the labour party but for this country is the appearance of division we remember the 1980s they backed the suggestion that unless the squabbling stopped the people briefing on behalf of the two men would be named and shamed the dressing down appears to have done the trick with mr brown joining his alleged rival alan milburn who the prime minister put in charge of election planning in mr brown s stead and deputy prime minister john prescott at an election poster launch but the effect of all this is to have achieved two things firstly nobody is attempting to suggest any more that the stories of the rift between the chancellor and the prime minister are fictions created by the media and authors even mr prescott admitted that had he still been a backbencher he would have been giving mr blair and mr brown the same message secondly it has also underlined the view that the election campaign has to all intents and purposes kicked off but whether the telling off and the subsequent change in behaviour by the two men will do any good or can even be sustained through the campaign remains to be seen even as the mps were expressing their fears it emerged that while mr brown is in africa for a week the prime minister is to deliver a keynote speech on election themes for a third term and he is expected to repeat his recent insistence that the next manifesto will be new labour through and through similarly some were pointing out that the chancellor during the election poster launch once again refused to deny the claim that he told the prime minister he could never trust anything he said none the less what some believe now is that the effect of the warnings from the backbenchers will actually be to silence the brown camp effectively strengthening the prime minister s hand for example will those brownite briefers suggest their man is unhappy at the prime minister s timing or subject matter as may have been the case in the past what all seem agreed on however is that this sniping simply cannot be allowed to go on through the election campaign mind you we have heard similar pledges before

2,robertson out to retain euro lure hearts manager john robertson hopes a place in the knock out stages of the uefa cup could help keep some of his out of contract players at the club it could help if we get through and have another european tie it may encourage players to stay at least until the end of the season he said if we manage to get through it shows how well the club s progressing they have to think whether they are going to get other clubs like that should they decide to move on a win for robertson s side against ferencvaros would put them through to the last 32 if basle fail to beat feyenoord it s very much the player s prerogative but the fact that we ve been playing european football for the last three or four years is obviously an incentive added robertson but we want players who want to play for the football club who are committed and a run in europe always helps a little bit with the game being played at murrayfield instead of tynecastle because of uefa regulations robertson sees both positive and negative aspects to the change of venue the pitch is not in the greatest condition the heineken cup game was there at the weekend and the pitch is a bit threadbare he said it s not ideal but it s the same for both teams so we just have to go out and there and perform that s the most important thing but he added if tynecastle could have hosted 30 000 it would have been fantastic but that s one of the benefits of murrayfield it allows us to bring even more of our supporters into it there will be a good atmosphere and the hearts fans have an important role to play we need their encouragement we need them to get right behind the side and make it as good an atmosphere as possible hopefully the players will respond to that and i know they will because it s a fantastic european night for the club

2,hodgson relishes european clashes former blackburn boss roy hodgson says the premiership should follow the rest of europe and have a winter break but insists that a gruelling domestic schedule will not damage the english elite s bid for champions league glory hodgson now in charge at viking stavanger was at liverpool s clash with bayer leverkusen at anfield on tuesday as a member of uefa s technical committee hodgson is a fierce advocate of the winter break employed throughout europe although not in england where the champions league contenders have ploughed through a heavy fixture list but hodgson told bbc sport that while he believes the premiership should embrace the idea he does not expect it to cost the english representatives in the last 16 of the champions league i just feel it is very difficult to say with certainty that teams who have had the break will have a definite edge i am a fervent supporter of the break it gives players the chance to recharge their batteries midway through the season which some suggest will give teams an advantage in the champions league the other school of thought suggests having a break then coming back to it puts you at a disadvantage the bigger discussions around the winter break should be to do with the nature of football today the needs of football players and the way the premiership has developed rather than one or two matches in the champions league in february hodgson believes a winter break carries many advantages explaining as i said it is the perfect chance to recharge batteries and certainly if i was still a manager in england i would be supporting any calls for its introduction in pre season you get a lot of enthusiasm and energy but by the time you get towards christmas many players having also played plenty of international matches for club and country and travelled a lot find themselves getting very jaded the break gives them a chance to recover that energy and enthusiasm and perhaps more importantly recover their mental strength during the break and get ready for the games ahead the mental side is by far the most important thing hodgson added the length of breaks can vary in italy the break was very short you just took christmas and new year it was so short you didn t do anything you gave the players a week or 10 days off then you were training for a week or 10 days and then went into a game if it is longer it is important those responsible for physical fitness give the players a programme to follow to ensure the physical strength they have accumulated stays with them and hodgson believes a winter break would be a positive step in the premiership he said if we talk about football at elite level which the premiership is then i would support a winter break if you examine the demands of the premier league and in particular on players who play international football for their club and country then a break would do them the world of good physically and mentally

0,online commons to spark debate online communities set up by the uk government could encourage public debate and build trust says the institute of public policy research ippr existing services such as ebay could provide a good blueprint for such services says the think tank although the net is becoming part of local and central government its potential has not yet been fully exploited to create an online commons for public debate in its report is online community a policy tool the ippr also asks if id cards could help create safer online communities adopting an ebay type model would let communities create their own markets for skills and services and help foster a sense of local identity and connection what we are proposing is a civic commons will davies senior research fellow at the ippr told the bbc news website a single publicly funded and run online community in which citizens can have a single place to go where you can go to engage in diversity and in a way that might have a policy implication like a pre legislation discussion the idea of a civic commons was originally proposed by stephen coleman professor of e democracy at the oxford internet institute the ippr report points to informal small scale examples of such commons that already exist it mentions good practice public initiatives like the bbc s ican project which connects people locally and nationally who want to take action around important issues but he adds government could play a bigger role in setting up systems of trust for online communities too proposals for id cards for instance could also be widened to see if they could be used online they could provide the basis for a secure authentication system which could have value for peer to peer interaction online at the moment they have been presented as a way for government to keep tabs on people and ensuring access to public services said mr davies but what has not been explored is how authentication technology may potentially play a role in decentralised online communities the key idea to take from systems such as ebay and other online communities is letting members rate each other s reputation by how they treat other members using a similar mechanism trust and cooperation between members of virtual and physical communities could be built this could mean a civic commons would work within a non market system which lets people who may disagree with one another interact within publicly recognised rules e government initiatives over the last decade have very much been about putting basic information and service guides online as well as letting people interact with government via the web many online communities such as chatrooms mailing lists community portals message boards and weblogs often form around common interests or issues with 53 of uk households now with access to the net the government suggests mr davies could act as an intermediary or middleman to set up public online places of debate and exchange to encourage more cosmopolitan politics and public trust in policy government already plays a critical role in helping citizens trade with each other online but it should also play a role in helping citizens connect to one another in civic non market interactions said mr davies there is a role for public bodies like the bbc libraries and government to bring people back into public debate again instead of millions of cliques talking to each other he added the paper is part of the ippr s digital society initiative which is producing a number of conferences and research papers leading up to the publication of a manifesto for a digital britain

2,tevez an argentine in brazil some 65 years ago bernardo gandulla left boca juniors in his native argentina and headed for brazil he arrived at the vasco da gama club with considerable prestige which he failed to live up to he left an impression but not for reasons he would have wanted the only thing of note he did was to throw the ball back when it went out of play even today gandula is the term used in brazil for ballboy brazilians delighted in the failure of gandulla then and many will delight now if history is repeated another boca juniors player is coming to brazil the new maradona carlos tevez is joining corinthians for nearly 20m in a strong candidate for the strangest move of the year corinthians or the london based company who have just entered into partnership with them appear to have paid well above the odds for tevez it is particularly strange as until last week tevez was not even an especially big name in brazil where the argentine championship is not shown presumably there is some financial logic behind the move what is harder to work out is why tevez should be interested in heading north rather than across the atlantic argentina s brightest new star hit top form in august as he spearheaded the charge towards the olympic gold medal but the subsequent months have not been easy for tevez boca re signed martin palermo forcing tevez to vacate his favoured centre forward role and off the pitch he gave the press plenty to report atletico madrid gave up on him after declaring his private life to be disorganized hounded by the press tevez grew tired of his life in buenos aires so now he says that he is heading for corinthians in search of tranquillity anyone acquainted with the city of s 227 o paulo will relish the nonsense of this declaration brazil s biggest city is a sprawling ugly restless metropolis once it shared with buenos aires the same melancholy air of a city of italian immigrants but that world now lies buried under skyscrapers the most turbulent place in this frenetic city is sport club corinthians it is the most passionately supported club in brazil pel 233 scored reams of goals against them reasoning that unless he did something special the corinthians fans were capable of winning the game on their own that passion can also be turned against the team especially nowadays when the level of urban violence gives a hysterical edge to life in brazil s big cities corinthians fans have invaded the dressing room or ambushed the team coach to attack the players tevez then can kiss tranquillity goodbye he can also say farewell to the copa libertadores south america s champions league corinthians have not qualified indeed he will have a long wait for a worthwhile match next year s brazilian championship only gets underway at the end of april until then he will have to make do with the foolish s 227 o paulo state championship an appalling waste of his talent there will be matches in small towns on poor pitches with plenty of defenders keen to kick him all the way back to argentina like so many of the top south american players tevez has the gift of being able to surprise to feint right and go left to pass when he was expected to dribble to shoot and catch the goalkeeper unawares but his choice of destination is the biggest surprise of all
2,safin plays down wimbledon hopes newly crowned australian open champion marat safin has ruled out any chance of winning wimbledon in the future after losing in round one last year safin said he had given up on wimbledon and winning his second grand slam title has not changed his mind i ll play but with no expectations i feel like i can t waste my time my energy on that surface he said some people they cannot play on clay some people they cannot play on a hard court me i can t play on grass however safin is hopeful that winning the australian open will give him the belief he needs to win more grand slam titles it s a relief for me two grand slams it s already something but with this one i worked really hard for it he said basically i would love to win a couple more i think i have a chance if i continue this way if coach peter lundgren will stick around with me and wants to work with me for a bit longer i think i can make it the 25 year old shocked pete sampras in the 2000 us open final to win his first major title but then lost in two australian open finals safin admitted he had begun to doubt whether he would win another grand slam i didn t expect that to win the 2000 us open it was against sampras i wasn t the favourite so i had no pressure whatsoever he said after the first final that i didn t win against thomas johansson in 2002 i couldn t see myself winning the grand slams anymore i was once in the semi finals of the french open but i didn t believe i can win it i just couldn t handle the pressure you need to believe in yourself and i didn t and after losing the first set 6 1 to lleyton hewitt in sunday s final safin said he began to doubt himself again i am 25 i m playing against hewitt at least you have to have the opportunity to win it at least have a chance he said it s like you go there and you lose first set 6 1 then you start to think this is not my day the way i m playing is ridiculous but then you start to really be a little bit more selfish and try to find a way out of there and i found it i was like really much i was much happier than in 2000 that s for sure because i get over it
2,benitez joy as reds take control liverpool boss rafael benitez was satisfied after his team s 3 1 win over bayer leverkusen despite conceding a goal in the last minute before the game if you had said the score will be 3 1 i would have happily accepted that said benitez but you must realise that you have to concentrate right to the very last seconds of a game at this level i have confidence that we can complete the task in germany i am always confident and we must be positive benitez defended goalkeeper jerzy dudek whose failure to hold on to dimitar berbatov s weak drive allowed franca to score with the last kick of the game and give the german team a lifeline for the second leg for me it was not jerzy dudek s fault added benitez he had played a very good game and had we scored our other chances nobody would be talking about about their goal it would not have mattered if we had scored our other chances it would not have been worth remembering that last goal in my opinion jerzy played well made two very fine saves and i am happy with him if we lose 2 0 we are out but i think we can score in germany certainly one and that will make all the difference and the liverpool boss is looking forward to having skipper steven gerrard who was suspended for the anfield leg back for the return in germany steven gerrard is a key player for us said benitez when he is on the pitch he makes everyone else play better and the opposition pay special attention to him which gives space for others steven is one of the best players in the world but i need a team that is not about just one player there must be 11 players on the pitch all doing well

1,firms pump billions into pensions employers have spent billions of pounds propping up their final salary pensions over the past year research suggests a survey of 280 schemes by incomes data services ids said employer contributions had increased from 5 5bn to 8 2bn a year a rise of 49 7 companies facing the biggest deficits had raised their pension contributions by 100 or more ids said many firms are struggling to keep this type of scheme open because of rising costs and increased liabilities a final salary scheme also known as a defined benefit scheme promises to pay a pension related to the salary the scheme member is earning when they retire the rising cost of maintaining such schemes has led many employers to replace final salary schemes with money purchase or defined contribution schemes these are less risky for employers under money purchase schemes employees pay into a pension fund which is used to buy an annuity a policy which pays out an income until death on retirement ids said there were some schemes in good health but in many cases firms had been forced to top up funds to tackle yawning deficits the level of contributions paid by employers has increased gradually since the late 1990s in 1998 99 for example contributions rose by 4 7 and in 2002 03 by 8 6 in contrast between 1996 and 1998 some employers cut their contribution levels helen sudell editor of the ids pensions service said the rise in contributions was staggering and the highest ever recorded by ids we have warned before that the widespread closure of final salary schemes to new entrants is just the beginning of a much bigger movement away from paternalistic provision said ms sudell with figures like this there can be little doubt that many employers will have to reduce future benefits at some point for those staff still in these schemes

4,blunkett sorry over murder plan david blunkett has apologised to mps after the home office announced prematurely via press release a review of murder laws the home secretary confirmed the review was to get under way in the wake of a law commission report which branded the current murder law as a mess he said the review would look at partial defences to murder including provocation and at mandatory sentences the home office has already said the review will begin next year on wednesday a home office spokeswoman said the terms of reference for the review had not been established but it was likely to include only england and wales news of the review was released because it was thought mr blunkett would make the official announcement in a commons debate on wednesday but the announcement never came with the home secretary saying the debate had never reached that stage amid opposition anger mr blunkett had to answer an emergency question in parliament on thursday he said he had taken steps to ensure the incident was not repeated shadow home secretary david davis welcomed his gracious apology and the review itself but he argued the minister should have volunteered a formal statement instead of having to be dragged to face mps in its report the law commission said it had found wide support among criminal justice professionals for an end to the mandatory life sentence for murder the panel suggested different kinds of murders could be graded to recognise the seriousness of the offence but the home office said mandatory life sentences would not be abolished and argued courts already had flexibility the commission an independent body including two judges a senior barrister and sentencing experts had been asked to consider reforms to the defence of provocation in murder cases but it said its proposals were unlikely to work without a far wider review of the law results of a consultation exercise showed 64 respondents out of 146 among them 21 judges believed a mandatory life sentence for every murder was indefensible and should cease a key question was whether one category should continue to cover all types of murder from mercy killings to serial or contract killings the commission found support for the idea of grading murders so that the sentence reflected the seriousness of the offence but speaking after the report was published home office minister baroness scotland said murder is the most serious of crimes and we have no intention of abolishing the mandatory life sentence where an offender is convicted of murder the court must pass a life sentence the commission also recommended tightening the law so that the provocation defence cannot be used in cases where someone has killed for revenge such as a jealous husband who murders an unfaithful wife

1,china had role in yukos split up china lent russia 6bn 3 2bn to help the russian government renationalise the key yuganskneftegas unit of oil group yukos it has been revealed the kremlin said on tuesday that the 6bn which russian state bank veb lent state owned rosneft to help buy yugansk in turn came from chinese banks the revelation came as the russian government said rosneft had signed a long term oil supply deal with china the deal sees rosneft receive 6bn in credits from china s cnpc according to russian newspaper vedomosti these credits would be used to pay off the loans rosneft received to finance the purchase of yugansk reports said cnpc had been offered 20 of yugansk in return for providing finance but the company opted for a long term oil supply deal instead analysts said one factor that might have influenced the chinese decision was the possibility of litigation from yukos yugansk s former owner if cnpc had become a shareholder rosneft and veb declined to comment the two companies rosneft and cnpc have agreed on the pre payment for long term deliveries said russian oil official sergei oganesyan there is nothing unusual that the pre payment is for five to six years the announcements help to explain how rosneft a medium sized indebted and relatively unknown firm was able to finance its surprise purchase of yugansk yugansk was sold for 9 3bn in an auction last year to help yukos pay off part of a 27bn bill in unpaid taxes and fines the embattled russian oil giant had previously filed for bankruptcy protection in a us court in an attempt to prevent the forced sale of its main production arm but yugansk was sold to a little known shell company which in turn was bought by rosneft yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder mikhail khodorkovsky once the country s richest man mr khodorkovsky is on trial for fraud and tax evasion the deal between rosneft and cnpc is seen as part of china s desire to secure long term oil supplies to feed its booming economy china s thirst for products such as crude oil copper and steel has helped pushed global commodity prices to record levels clearly the chinese are trying to get some leverage in russia said dmitry lukashov an analyst at brokerage aton they understand property rights in russia are not the most important rights and they are more interested in guaranteeing supplies if the price of oil is fixed under the deal which is unlikely it could be very profitable for the chinese mr lukashov continued and rosneft is in desperate need of cash so it s a good deal for them too

0,what high definition will do to dvds first it was the humble home video then it was the dvd and now hollywood is preparing for the next revolution in home entertainment high definition high definition gives incredible 3d like pictures and surround sound the dvd disks and the gear to play them will not be out for another year or so and there at are still a number of issues to be sorted out but when high definition films do come out on the new format dvds it will profoundly change home entertainment for rick dean director of business development for digital content company thx a high definition future is an exciting prospect he has worked on the star wars dvd trilogy finding nemo the incredibles and indiana jones there was a time not so long ago when the film world and the video world were two completely separate worlds he told the bbc news website the technology we are dealing with now means they are very much conjoined the film that we see in theatres is coming from the same digital file that we take the home video master he says but currently putting a master feature film onto dvd requires severe compression because current dvd technology cannot hold as much as high definition films demand as much as you compress the picture data rate wise you also take qualities away from the picture that we fight so hard to keep in the master he explains i would love to be able to show people what projects that we worked on really look like in the high def world and i find it very exciting high definition dvds can hold up to six times more data than the dvds we are used to it will take time though to persuade people who spent money on dvd players to buy the different players and displays required to watch high definition dvds in 18 months time mr dean is confident though i think if they see real hd high definition not some heavily compressed version of it there is such a remarkable difference i have heard comments from people who say the images pop off the screen high definition will mean some changes for those working behind the scenes too on the whole producing films for high definition dvds will be easier in some ways because less compression is needed equally it may mean hollywood studios ask for more to be put onto the average dvd when we master movies right now our data rates are running at about 1 2 gigabits per second says mr dean our dvds that we put out today have to be squashed down to about five or six megabits per second that s a huge amount of compression that has to be applied about 98 so if you have anything that allows more space you don t have to compress so hard studios could fit a lot more marketing material games and features onto high capacity dvds currently an entire dvd project can take up to three months says mr dean although the step of down converting will be bypassed this will realistically only save a day s work says mr dean one of the most time consuming elements is building dvd navigation and menu systems on the fairly complex star wars disks making sure the menu buttons worked took 45 human hours alone if studios want to cash in on the extra space it could mean extra human hours for which someone has to pay if the decision on the studio side is that they are going to put a lot more on these disks it could be more expensive because of all the extra navigation that is required and if studios do focus on delivering more added value content thinks mr dean ultimately it could mean that they will want more money for it those costs could filter down to the price ticket on a high definition dvd but if the consumer is not willing to pay a premium price studios will listen thinks mr dean high definition throws up other challenge to film makers and dvd production alike more clarity on screen means film makers have to make doubly sure that attention to detail is meticulous when we did the first hd version of star wars episode i everybody was very sun tanned but that was make up in the hd version of episode i all these make up lines showed up explains mr dean the restoration of the older star wars episodes revealed some interesting items too there are scans of a corridor on the death star and fairly plainly in one of those shots there is a file cabinet stuck behind one of the doorways you never used to be able to see it because things are just blurred enough during the pan that you just didn t see it what high definition revolution ultimately means is that the line between home entertainment and cinema worlds will blur with home theatre systems turning living rooms into cinemas this line blurs even further it could also mean that how we get films and in what format will widen in the future we are going to look towards file delivery over ip internet protocol broadband giving a dvd like experience from the set top box to the hard drive says mr dean but that is some time off for most and for now people still like to show off something physical in their bookshelves
1,manufacturing recovery slowing uk manufacturing grew at its slowest pace in one and a half years in january according to a survey the chartered institute of purchasing and supply cips said its purchasing manager index pmi fell to 51 8 from a revised 53 3 in december but despite missing forecasts of 53 7 the pmi number remained above 50 indicating expansion in the sector the cips said that the strong pound had dented exports while rising oil and metals prices had kept costs high the survey added that rising input prices and cooling demand had deterred factory managers from hiring new workers in an effort to cut costs that triggered the second successive monthly fall in the cips employment index to 48 3 its lowest level since june 2003 the survey is more upbeat than official figures which suggest that manufacturing is in recession but analysts said the survey did suggest that the manufacturing recovery was running out of steam it appears that the uk is in a two tier economy again said prebon yamane economist lena komileva you have weakness in manufacturing which i think would concern policymakers at the bank of england

1,soaring oil hits world economy the soaring cost of oil has hit global economic growth although world s major economies should weather the storm of price rises according to the oecd in its latest bi annual report the oecd cut its growth predictions for the world s main industrialised regions us growth would reach 4 4 in 2004 but fall to 3 3 next year from a previous estimate of 3 7 the oecd said however the paris based economics think tank said it believed the global economy could still regain momentum forecasts for japanese growth were also scaled back to 4 0 from 4 4 this year and 2 1 from 2 8 in 2005 but the outlook was worst for the 12 member eurozone bloc with already sluggish growth forecasts slipping to 1 8 from 2 0 this year and 1 9 from 2 4 in 2005 the oecd said overall the report forecast total growth of 3 6 in 2004 for the 30 member countries of the oecd slipping to 2 9 next year before recovering to 3 1 in 2006 there are nonetheless good reasons to believe that despite recent oil price turbulence the world economy will regain momentum in a not too distant future said jean philippe cotis the oecd s chief economist the price of crude is about 50 higher than it was at the start of 2004 but down on the record high of 55 67 set in late october a dip in oil prices and improving jobs prospects would improve consumer confidence and spending the oecd said the oil shock is not enormous by historical standards we have seen worse in the seventies if the oil price does not rise any further then we think the shock can be absorbed within the next few quarters vincent koen a senior economist with the oecd told the bbc s world business report the recovery that was underway and has been interrupted a bit by the oil shock this year would then regain momentum in the course of 2005 china s booming economy and a spectacular comeback in japan albeit one that has faltered in recent months would help world economic recovery the oecd said supported by strong balance sheets and high profits the recovery of business investment should continue in north america and start in earnest in europe it added however the report warned it remains to be seen whether continental europe will play a strong supportive role through a marked upswing of final domestic demand the oecd highlighted current depressed household expenditure in germany and the eurozone s over reliance on export led growth
4,immigration to be election issue immigration and asylum have normally been issues politicians from the big parties have tiptoed around at election time but no longer both labour and the tories have signalled their intention of making them central to their election campaigns they have been struck by the level of concern amongst voters about the issues with internal surveys showing they have the potential to swing large numbers of votes that was also true at the last general election and the issue did briefly become a campaigning issue but it sparked the probably predictable furore with claims politicians were either stoking up xenophobia or alternatively running scared of addressing the problem but this time around it looks set to be one of the core battlegrounds with both the big parties competing to set out tough policies the tories are already committed to imposing annual limits on immigration with a quota for asylum seekers and with applications processed outside the uk labour has already branded the proposal unworkable but party strategists have seen the tories seizing a poll advantage over the issue now home secretary charles clarke has come up with alternative proposals for a points system to ensure only immigrants who can benefit the economy will be granted entry and to kick out more failed asylum seekers that has been attacked by the tories as too little too late and for failing to tackle the key issue of the numbers entering the uk the liberal democrats have not been drawn too deeply into the argument but have called for a europe wide policy on immigration but while all the parties appear to agree the time has come to properly debate and address the issue there are already signs they will run into precisely the same problems as before former union leader sir bill morris has already accused both the big parties of engaging in a bidding war about who can be nastiest to asylum seekers my concern is that whilst the labour party and the conservative party will take a constructive approach to the debate right wing political parties picking up on statements like burden to britain will exploit this and create a lot of fear and uncertainty it is precisely that concern and the possible suggestion the issue is playing to the far right s racist agenda that will provoke strong reactions from many concerned with this issue the challenge for the big parties is to ensure they can engage in the debate during the cut and thrust of a general election while also avoiding that trap

4,uk heading wrong way howard tony blair has had the chance to tackle the problems facing britain and has failed michael howard has said britain is heading in the wrong direction the conservative leader said in his new year message mr blair s government was a bossy interfering government that takes decisions that should be made by individuals he added but labour s campaign spokesman fraser kemp responded britain is working don t let the tories wreck it again mr howard also paid tribute to the nation s character for its generous response to the asian quake disaster the catastrophe was overshadowing the hopes for the future at this usually positive time of the year mr howard said we watched the scenes of destruction with a sense of disbelief the scale the speed the ferocity of what happened on boxing day is difficult to grasp yet britain s response has shone a light on our nation s character the last week has shown that the warm caring heart of britain beats as strong as ever he went on to reflect on the values that most britons hold dear looking ahead to the coming general election he pledged to turn these beliefs into reality and set out the choices he says are facing britain how much tax do people want to pay who will give taxpayers value for money the clean hospitals and good disciplined schools they want who can be trusted to get a grip on the disorder on our streets and the chaos in our immigration system mr blair has failed to tackle these problems he claimed saying he has the wrong solution to them the result is big government and higher taxes eroding incentives undermining enterprise and denying people choice worst of all it is a government that has wasted people s money and failed to tackle the problems families face today the tories he said can cut crime and improve public services without asking people to pay more taxes we can have progress without losing what makes britain great its tolerance the respect for the rule of law the ability of everyone to fulfil their potential we simply need to change direction the election will give britain the chance to change this is the record mr blair will have to defend in the coming months he said urging voters to hold him to account but labour spokesman mr kemp said it would be more appropriate for this message to come out on 1 april not 1 january let us never forget that when michael howard was in government britain suffered mass unemployment 15 interest rates record home repossessions and the introduction of the poll tax with labour britain is working rather than alluding to false promises michael howard should be starting 2005 with an apology to the british people for the misery that the government of which he was a member inflicted upon the country

4,mps criticise child access system divorced parents seeking access to their children are often disadvantaged by the legal system mps have said the constitutional affairs select committee said parents with custody could exploit delays in the system to stop former partners gaining access courts should be used as a last resort but where they are their orders should be enforced more rigorously mps said but they rejected the claim made by some campaign groups that there should be a legal presumption of equal access currently the presumption is that the interests of the child are paramount an arbitrary template imposed on all families whatever the needs of the child would relegate the welfare of individual children to a secondary position the mps said they said the law should be changed to require family courts specifically to take account of the importance of sustaining the relationship between the child and the non resident parent in contested cases this would reassert the rights of non resident parents to contact with their children as well as the rights of children to contact with both their parents while maintaining sufficient flexibility to cope with issues of safety they said delays in court hearings and the inability to effectively enforce court orders allowed a new status quo arrangement for the children to become established by default they said although the courts rigorously avoid conscious bias there are considerable grounds for accepting that non resident parents are frequently disadvantaged by the system as it is administered at present given the strong animosity between the parties which is common in contested family cases we find it hard to believe that tactical delay is not sometimes used to the advantage of resident parents committee chairman alan beith said the five month inquiry had been a complex and emotive one at the moment far too many contact and residency cases are being dealt with by the courts when they could be better resolved through professional mediation and negotiation he said this situation has to change the court system should only be used as a last resort where mediation and negotiation have completely broken down or where issues of abuse or domestic violence need to be dealt with this will help to reduce delays and improve the lives of many children across the country

4,police urge pub closure power new powers are needed to close disorderly pubs bars and clubs for up to a week or even permanently police chiefs have told mps association of chief police officers president chris fox said the current 24 hour closure power did not have enough impact on bad landlords mr fox s comments follow the controversy over plans to allow pubs to open around the clock he rejected critics calls for the law change to be delayed instead the new licensing act could help reduce drunken disorder but only if it was properly planned he argued acpo made its call for stronger closure powers in a paper for the commons home affairs select committee after the meeting mr fox said being able to close premises for only 24 hours did not necessarily make an impact if it s 12 30 on a saturday morning and you close for 24 hours there s not a lot of pain for the premises because they probably wouldn t open on sunday anyway this is about getting through to the management that they can t run a disorderly house without facing some immediate sanctions under acpo s proposal the closure orders would be used only with the agreement of the local licensing authority the new licensing laws will give police greater powers to close pubs and clubs but only for 24 hour periods mr fox said the drinks industry was currently not regulating itself it s making money at the cost of human misery and the public purse and the strategic planning process has been less than useless he said mr fox said the new laws due to start being phased in next month could help if food outlets public transport and public toilets could cope with late night drinkers staggering it closing hours will be a solution if the infrastructure is there if the premises are properly managed and people aren t being served rolling drunk and underage and then tossed out into the street he said we have the problem from 11pm to 2am in any event we have to get a grip on the underlying causes of this acpo wants pubs and clubs which cause extra work for police and hospitals to have to pay towards the costs home secretary charles clarke is currently looking at the idea of a levy on the drinks industry to pay for the cost of extra policing the licensing changes have sparked concern among some mps councils and some senior police officers who fear they could exacerbate drinking problems culture secretary tessa jowell on tuesday said it was not her job to bow to the campaign against the changes it was the status quo not the new laws which were causing current binge drinking problems she told bbc two s newsnight leaked documents have suggested ex home secretary david blunkett branded new opening hours as a leap in the dark but ms jowell insisted his concerns had been met the police s job against alcohol related crime would be made easier if all pubs did not close at the same time she added
4,tories unveil quango blitz plans plans to abolish 162 quangos have been unveiled by the conservatives as part of their effort to show how government red tape can be cut six government units would also be scrapped under proposals which the tories say would save more than 4 3bn among the targets are strategic health authorities and the new fair access regulator for universities tory frontbencher john redwood said britain needed a slimmer government and lower taxes to be competitive the plans would abolish regional assemblies and other regional bodies such as boards tackling industrial development and housing their powers would be returned to elected local councils or national government the tories say the strategic health authorities are not needed as it is better that local people rather than officials run hospitals and surgeries announcing the plans mr redwood said mr blair has forgotten the interests of taxpayers and has broken the pledges he made far from improving public services spending taxpayers money on quangos has led only to more bureaucrats more regulation and higher taxes his party leader michael howard argued a change in direction was needed to get a grip on spending labour are creating two britains the britain of the forgotten majority and bureaucratic britain he said in the real world people are working harder just to stand still they ve seen their pensions knocked for six they re being squeezed by extra taxes the forgotten majority are paying the price of bureaucratic britain the government has announced plans to cut 100 000 civil servants as part of its efficiency drive but chief secretary to the treasury paul boateng attacked the tory plans the conservatives are committed to cutting labour s public spending plans by a massive 35 billion he said cuts on this scale cannot be found from cutting bureaucracy but would require massive cuts to front line public services such as schools hospitals and the police the liberal democrats have said they would cut the number of whitehall departments to make sure money reaches frontline services

1,giving financial gifts to children your child or grandchild may want the latest toy this christmas but how about giving them a present that will help their financial future gifts of the financial variety might have a longer lasting impact it may encourage children to save or start a fund which could count towards university costs for example the government is trying to encourage saving at an early age through its new child trust fund the first vouchers worth 250 or 500 for low income families will be distributed from january all children born after 1st september 2002 will be eligible parents will need to decide which financial institution will manage this gift in time for the start of the scheme in april 2005 parents and relatives will be able to top up the fund with up to 1 200 a year which will grow free of income and capital gains tax as the child trust fund will not be in force in time for christmas relatives could invest their gifts in a higher rate children s deposit account and use this as a feeder fund there are accounts designed to start children off in the savings habit and they often pay a higher rate of interest some of the best instant access accounts currently available include the ladybird account from the saffron walden building society paying 5 35 for a minimum balance of 1 and the alliance leicester firstsaver which pays 5 25 also starting at 1 interest earned by children is subject to income tax however children like adults have a personal income tax allowance 4 745 for the current tax year if the account holds money gifted by friends and relatives but not parents any interest earned from the savings account may be set against the allowance as long as the total amount of interest falls within the allowance then no tax will be payable when the account is opened a form r85 available from the bank or building society should be completed this confirms that the account holder is a non taxpayer and allows interest to be received without the deduction of income tax the tax rules are different for parents who save on behalf of a child only 100 of interest per parent can be tax free where interest exceeds this level the whole of the interest will be taxed on the parent this is to prevent parents from holding their own cash savings in their children s names and taking advantage of the tax allowances where both parents and other relatives are saving on behalf of a child consideration should be given to opening separate accounts one for parents gifts and one for gifts from other relatives therefore it may be preferable for parents to contribute to the child trust fund which is tax free with any gifts from relatives that take the total above the annual 1 200 limit being directed to a deposit account another favourite solution is premium bonds with the promise of riches far greater than a mere deposit account they make great presents the parent or guardian will be responsible for the bonds and will receive notification of the purchase any prizes will be sent to the parent or child s guardian the minimum for each purchase is 100 and bonds are sold in multiples of 10 there are gift opportunities beyond cash accounts and these should not be ignored over the longer term stock market funds have outperformed other types of investment although in the shorter term they can be volatile one of the benefits of investing for children is that investment is generally for the longer term more than ten years which helps to reduce the risks associated with investing in shares one way to spread the risk is to invest in the stock market through a unit or investment trust these are pooled investment funds which give access to a wide range of shares these funds may be actively managed where a fund manager picks individual stocks based on a view of their future potential or passive where a manager invests in all the shares that comprise a stock market index for example the ftse 100 exchange traded funds offer an alternative way to track a stock market these are single shares that give the return of an underlying index so are really another form of tracker the difference is that the charges are quite low the only drawback with all financial gifts is that the children gain an absolute right to the money at age 18 and parents will have no control over how it is spent for larger gifts it may be worthwhile taking professional advice on the establishment of a suitable trust that will allow ongoing control over the capital and income
4,custody death rate shocks mps deaths in custody have reached shocking levels a committee of mps and peers has warned the joint committee on human rights found those committing suicide were mainly the most vulnerable with mental health drugs or alcohol problems members urged the government to set up a task force to tackle deaths in prisons police cells detention centres and special hospitals there was one prison suicide every four days between 1999 and 2003 mps said the report which followed a year long inquiry by the committee found the high death rate amounts to a serious failure to protect the right to life of a highly vulnerable group many of those who ended up taking their own lives had presented themselves to the authorities with these problems before they even offended the report said it questioned whether prison was the most appropriate place for them to be kept and whether earlier intervention would have meant custody could have been avoided increased resources and a reduction in the use of imprisonment was needed to address the issue in the longer term the report said committee chairman labour mp jean corston said each and every death in custody is a death too many regardless of the circumstances yet throughout our inquiry we have seen time and time again that extremely vulnerable people are entering custody with a history of mental illness drug and alcohol problems and potential for taking their own lives these highly vulnerable people are being held within a structure glaringly ill suited to meet even their basic needs crime levels are falling but we are holding more people in custody than ever before the misplaced over reliance on the prison system for some of the most vulnerable people in the country is at the heart of the problems that we encountered until we change our whole approach to imprisoning vulnerable people we cannot begin to meet our positive obligations under article 2 of the european convention on human rights and meet our duty of care to them the committee also highlighted deeply worrying cases of children and young people taking their own lives between 1990 and 2004 25 children have taken their own lives in prison and two have died in secure training centres it picked out the case of joseph scholes who hanged himself from the bars of his cell in stoke heath young offender institution in march 2002 and urged the home secretary to hold a public inquiry it revealed that two weeks before his court appearance for a series of robberies the 16 year old was depressed exhibiting suicidal tendencies and slashed his face with a knife about 30 times even though the trial judge had been alerted to his experience of sexual abuse and mental illness he was sentenced to a two year detention and training order nine days into his sentence joseph hung himself from the bars of his cell window with a sheet

0,musicians upbeat about the net musicians are embracing the internet as a way of reaching new fans and selling more music a survey has found the study by us researchers pew internet suggests musicians do not agree with the tactics adopted by the music industry against file sharing while most considered file sharing as illegal many disagreed with the lawsuits launched against downloaders even successful artists don t think the lawsuits will benefit musicians said report author mary madden for part of the study pew internet conducted an online survey of 2 755 musicians songwriters and music publishers via musician membership organisations between march and april 2004 they ranged from full time successful musicians to artists struggling to make a living from their music we looked at more of the independent musicians rather than the rockstars of this industry but that reflects more accurately the state of the music industry ms madden told the bbc news website we always hear the views of successful artists like the britneys of the world but the less successful artists rarely get represented the survey found that musicians were overwhelming positive about the internet rather than seeing it as just a threat to their livelihood almost all of them used the net for ideas and inspiration with nine out of 10 going online to promote advertise and post their music on the web more than 80 offered free samples online while two thirds sold their music via the net independent musicians in particular saw the internet as a way to get around the need to land a record contract and reach fans directly musicians are embracing the internet enthusiastically said ms madden they are using the internet to gain inspiration sell it online tracking royalties learning about copyright perhaps surprisingly opinions about online file sharing were diverse and not as clear cut as those of the record industry through the recording industry association of america riaa it has pursued an aggressive campaign through the courts to sue people suspected of sharing copyrighted music but the report suggests this campaign does not have the wholehearted backing of musicians in the us it found that most artists saw file sharing as both good and bad though most agreed that it should be illegal free downloading has killed opportunities for new bands to break without major funding and backing said one musician quoted by the report it s hard to keep making records if they don t pay for themselves through sales however 60 said they did not think the lawsuits against song swappers would benefit musicians and songwriters many suggested that rather than fighting file sharing the music industry needed to recognise the changes it has brought and embrace it both successful and struggling musicians were more likely to say that the internet has made it possible for them to make more money from their music rather than make it harder for them to protect their material from piracy said ms madden

1,bush to outline toughest budget president bush is to send his toughest budget proposals to date to the us congress seeking large cuts in domestic spending to lower the deficit about 150 federal programs could be cut or axed altogether as part of a 2 5 trillion 1 3 trillion package aimed at curbing the giant us budget deficit defence spending will rise however while the proposals exclude the cost of continuing military operations in iraq vice president dick cheney said the budget was the tightest so far at the heart of the administration s fifth budget presented to congress on monday is an austere package of domestic measures these would see discretionary spending rise below the projected level of inflation such belt tightening is designed to tackle the massive budget deficit increases of president bush s first term mr cheney admitted that the budget was the toughest of the bush presidency but argued it was fair and responsible it is not something we have done with a meat axe nor are we suddenly turning our back on the most needy people in our society he said the wars in iraq and afghanistan increased expenditure on national security after 9 11 and the 2001 recession wiped out the budget surplus inherited by president bush in 2001 and turned it into a record deficit the shortfall is projected to rise to 427bn in 2005 education environmental protection and transport initiatives are set to be scaled back as a first step towards reducing the deficit to 230bn by 2009 most controversially the government is seeking to cut the medicaid budget which provides health care to the nation s poorest by 45bn and to reduce farm subsidies by 587m spending on defence and homeland security is set to increase although not by as much as originally planned president bush s proposals would see the pentagon s budget rise by 19bn to 419 3bn while homeland security would get an extra 2bn the budget does not include the cost of running military operations in iraq and afghanistan for which the administration in expected to seek an extra 80bn from congress later this year also not featuring in the proposals is the cost of funding the administration s radical proposed overhaul of social security provision some expects believe this could require borrowing of up to 4 5bn trillion over a twenty year period despite the republicans holding a majority in both houses of congress the proposals will be fiercely contested over the next few months john mccain a republican senator said he was pleased the administration was prepared to tackle the deficit with the deficits that we are now running i am glad the president is coming over with a very austere budget he said however democratic senator kent conrad said the proposals exposed the country to huge financial commitments beyond 2009 the cost of everything he president bush advocates explodes he said

0,new consoles promise big problems making games for future consoles will require more graphic artists and more money an industry conference has been told sony microsoft and nintendo will debut their new consoles at the annual e3 games expo in los angeles in may these so called next generation machines will be faster than current consoles and capable of displaying much higher quality visuals for gamers this should make for better more immersive games in a pre recorded video slot during microsoft s keynote address at the game developers conference held last week in san francisco famed director james cameron revealed he is making a game in tandem with his next film believed to be battle angel alita the game s visual quality would be like a lucid dream said mr cameron but numerous speakers warned that creating such graphics will require more artists and so next generation console games will be much more expensive to develop the first new console microsoft s xbox 2 is not expected to reach the shops until the end of 2005 games typically take at least 18 months to create however so developers are grappling with the hardware today according to robert walsh head of brisbane based game developer krome studios next generation games will cost between 10 25m to make with teams averaging 80 staff in size taking two years to complete a title such sums mean it will be difficult for anyone to start a new game studio said mr walsh if you re a start up i doubt that a publisher is going to walk in and give you a cheque for 10m however good you are he said mr walsh suggested that new studios should make games for mobile phones and handheld consoles like the sony psp and the nintendo ds since they are cheaper and easier to create than console games one developer bucking the trend towards big art teams is will wright the creator of the best selling the sims games the founder of california s maxis studio surprised the conference with a world exclusive preview of his next game spore spore will allow players to experiment with the evolution of digital creatures starting with an amoeba sized organism the player will guide the physical development of their creature by selecting how its limbs jaws and other body parts evolve eventually the creature will become capable of establishing cities trading and fighting and even building space ships advanced players will visit the home planets of creatures created by other spore players these worlds will be automatically swapped across the internet mr wright said that enabling players to devise and share their creatures would make them care more about the game i don t want to put the player in the role of luke skywalker or frodo baggins i want them to be george lucas or dr seuss explained mr wright few games have hinted at the scope of spore but mr wright explained that he has nevertheless kept his development team small by hiring expert programmers instead of employing lots of artists to create 3d models of the digital creatures spore generates and displays the creatures according to rules devised by the programmers the thing i am coming away with from the conference is that next generation content is going to be really expensive and creating it will drive the smaller players out of the market said mr wright i d like to offer an alternative to that new development tools will be another important aid in making next generation games and dozens of companies demonstrated their latest products at the conference oxford based natural motion launched endorphin v2 0 which enables artists to direct a 3d virtual actor the actor is realistically modelled according to the laws of physics endorphin simulates how the actor falls down stairs for instance or crumples up after a gunshot artists can blend together these visual sequences and include the results in their games the process is much quicker than having an artist animate each movement by hand and so lessens the need for larger art teams another british company aiming to reduce the workload of artists is manchester start up genemation its latest tool gencrowd enables artists to create unique photo realistic human faces for games involving lots of people gencrowd works by blending together elements of an in built supply of stock faces of differing ages and ethnicities the software can create up to 2 000 new heads an hour one area not yet dominated by graphical blockbusters is mobile phone games even the latest phones are not as powerful as the consoles of a decade ago so smaller teams of half a dozen people can still create complete games for the devices the game developers conference included a special two day summit dedicated to creating mobile games a niche attraction for a few dozen conference attendees when it began five years ago gdc s mobile summit this year drew several hundred delegates mobile games are a fast growing sector because newer phones have better graphics and sound and are thus more suitable for playing games furthermore the adoption of mobile phones continues to spread across the world it s predicted that by 2006 two billion people will own a mobile phone the growing importance of mobile gaming was reflected by a keynote given by john batter general manager at ea mobile ea mobile is a division of electronic arts the biggest games publisher until recently electronic arts had been dismissive of games for phones the last time you checked ea wasn t in this business mr batter admitted but he said ea now planned on dominating the market by releasing mobile versions of its most popular franchises ea plans to release up to 20 mobile games over the next 12 months the first will be a version of its need for speed racing game created by ea mobile s 30 person development team mr batter predicted that by 2006 mobile phones would be capable of running games of comparable quality to those on sony s upcoming psp handheld console owain bennallack is the editor of develop magazine

4,ministers naive over phone taps the government is being naive by refusing to allow phone tap evidence in court a senior eu politician says javier solana eu foreign policy chief says phone tap evidence works in the courts of other european countries human rights groups top police officers and many mps say allowing the evidence would remove the need to detain terror suspects without charge but home secretary charles clarke says the evidence would not make much difference to these cases mr solana told itv1 s jonathan dimbleby programme phone tap evidence in court works it is normal that it is done it would be naive not to do it it would be naive not to use this technological thing that we have at our disposal mr solana s comments come the day after sir ian blair the newly appointed metropolitan police commissioner said he was in favour of phone tap evidence under the anti terrorism crimes and security act 2001 foreign terror suspects can be detained in british jails without trial or charge several suspects have been detained under these powers because evidence against them was deemed too sensitive to be heard in court some of this evidence is believed to be telephone intercepts human rights group liberty has argued that if intercept evidence could be heard these detainees could be brought to trial but critics of phone tap trials say the evidence is often weak and can expose the methods of the security services the home secretary says intercepts would not make much difference because cases against terror suspects frequently rely on other kinds of surveillance but mr clarke has been forced to change the regime of detention without trial after law lords ruled it illegal he has opted for a system of control orders whereby suspects both british and foreign can be held under house arrest or surveillance these orders will again involve a uk opt out of parts of the european convention on human rights while accepting that people have to be prepared for a possible terrorist attack mr solana said he had qualms about the home secretary s new plans we have to fight terrorism with all our means but not so far as to change our way of life he said
4,profile gordon brown the ultimate prize of 10 downing street may continue to elude him but as he prepares to deliver a record breaking ninth budget gordon brown can at least console himself with the thought that he is the longest serving chancellor of modern times he reached that milestone last june when he overtook david lloyd george who served for seven years and 43 days between 1908 and 1915 how much longer mr brown will continue in the job is not clear he once said there are two types of chancellor those who fail and those who get out in time there are rumours he will be moved to the foreign office if labour wins the general election but for now mr brown dominates the domestic political scene like few chancellors or politicians before him gordon brown was born in glasgow on 20 february 1951 the son of a church of scotland minister in the small fife town of kirkcaldy at 12 he was canvassing for labour and by his 20s he was a leading political activist in scotland he achieved a first class degree in history from edinburgh university where he went on to complete a phd his early career was spent lecturing working in television and making a name for himself in the scottish labour party his first attempt to enter westminster for edinburgh south in 1979 was thwarted by the present tory spokesman on foreign affairs michael ancram but in 1983 he took dunfermline east a new constituency including rosyth naval base pit villages and coastal towns entering westminster he came to share an office with the newly elected mp for sedgefield tony blair within four years mr brown had gained his first frontbench post as shadow chief secretary to the treasury he became shadow chancellor under john smith s leadership in 1992 after the death of leader john smith in 1994 he stood aside agreeing to give tony blair a clear run at the leadership during a now infamous meal at the granita restaurant in islington the other part of the deal that mr blair will one day stand down in favour of the chancellor is the stuff of westminster legend mr blair s supporters say such a deal never existed and endless newspaper columns and even a television film have been devoted to the alleged deal but if his leadership ambitions were at least temporarily thwarted in 1994 mr brown continued his devotion to politics during the 1997 election campaign he is said to have worked an average of 18 hours a day six days a week after running on a treadmill for an hour each morning this dedication to his career was underlined by a comment by mr brown s former girlfriend of five years princess marguerite of romania the eldest daughter of ex king michael of romania who said a relationship with him was politics politics politics if that was true then mr brown who married pr executive sarah macaulay in 2000 changed his perspective when the couple were hit by tragedy early in 2002 their daughter jennifer died in edinburgh royal infirmary 10 days after being born seven weeks prematurely a year later in october 2003 the couple had a son john an event which again gave the chancellor an opportunity to show his softer side a trip to africa earlier this year to publicise his scheme to cancel the debt of poor nations also gave the chancellor an opportunity to show his more human side the ideological differences between mr brown and mr blair remain relatively modest the chancellor opposes the further encroachment of the market into the nhs and is seen as being more old labour than mr blair in his approach to wealth redistribution but their shared belief that market economics are compatible with social justice continues to form the ideological heart of the new labour project yet they are portrayed by the media as being locked in almost permanent conflict with mr brown supposedly nursing resentment at being betrayed by his younger downing street neighbour over the succession mr blair for his part is said to be frustrated that his public service reforms are being thwarted by a vengeful mr brown who reportedly delights in keeping the prime minister in the dark over the contents of his budget until the last possible minute after a recent run of negative headlines labour mps took the unprecedented step of making a direct appeal to the two men stop bickering for the good of the party events like this and the testimony of former ministerial colleagues make it impossible to dismiss the brown blair feud as just journalistic hearsay cooked up by hacks and camp followers in the hothouse atmosphere of westminster how much it damages the ability of government to do its job is open to question a truce appears to have been called in the run up to the general election after a fresh spat was sparked by blairite alan milburn being brought in over the head of mr brown to run the election campaign but with the tories having appeared to get the better of the pre election campaign thus far there are reports that mr brown using the budget as a springboard is to revitalise labour s campaign amid all this it is easy to forget that mr brown remains the man most likely to succeed mr blair as labour leader there may be no shortage of possible contenders for the crown including mr milburn but none can command the sort of support in the parliamentary party and beyond that mr brown can and mr blair s decision to name his own retirement date

4,tory leader unveils spending plan tory leader michael howard says his party can save 35bn in government spending by tackling waste the money would be ploughed back into frontline services like the nhs and schools with the rest used to cut government borrowing and reduce taxes the tory leader has also shrugged off the defection of one of his mps robert jackson a former minister to labour mr howard said that these things happened in politics and it would not affect the outcome of the election let s be realistic the election is not going to be decided on the basis of what mr jackson did he told bbc 1 s breakfast with frost programme however the defection on saturday has cast a shadow over the launch of the conservatives spending plans fuller details are due to be unveiled on monday the bulk of the 35bn saved by tackling bureaucracy and inefficient systems will go back into frontline services mr howard said the 12bn left over would then be spent on reducing government borrowing he added however the remainder would deal with some of the unfair taxes almost every independent expert says if you get another labour government you are going to have to pay higher taxes mr howard insisted because borrowing is going up it is out of control that is bound to lead to higher taxes or higher interest rates or both so part of the 12bn we are going to apply to filling the government s black hole reducing the borrowing the rest will be used to reduce these unfair taxes which are bearing so heavily on the people of our country today mr howard is expected to say that around 6bn will be available for tax cuts when he makes his announcement on monday the cuts will be paid for out of the savings identified by business trouble shooter david james home office spending could be cut by 1 6bn according to the final instalment of his year long review savings of 153m at the foreign office and 336m at the department for culture media and sport have also been identified in all almost a quarter of a million jobs and 168 public bodies would go under mr james proposals mr howard said all this adds up to a bottom line and the bottom line is at this election people will have a clear choice between mr blair who will waste more and tax more and a conservative government that will give them value for money and tax less however chief treasury secretary paul boateng said none of the tories figures add up so they can t make these savings and can t pay for any tax cuts which means the only guaranteed cut from the tories is 35bn of cuts hitting frontline public services hard liberal democrat leader charles kennedy added people will not be taken in by michael howard s claims of 35bn worth of savings this can t be achieved without drastic cuts in local services in their own communities a poll for the news of the world newspaper suggests the conservatives are on course for their worst election defeat in a century labour will hold key marginal constituencies winning a majority of 160 the populus survey suggests and the liberal democrats will take three key seats from the conservatives leaving the tories with just 163 mps two less than they returned atlabour s 1997 landslide and their worst showing since 1906
1,call centre users lose patience customers trying to get through to call centres are getting impatient and quicker to hang up a survey suggests once past the welcome message callers on average hang up after just 65 seconds of listening to canned music the drop in patience comes as the number of calls to call centres is growing at a rate of 20 every year customers are getting used to the idea of an always available society says cara diemont of it firm dimension data which commissioned the survey however call centres also saw a sharp increase of customers simply abandoning calls she says from just over 5 in 2003 to a record 13 3 during last year when automated phone message systems are taken out of the equation where customers have to pick their way through multiple options and messages the number of abandoned calls is even higher a sixth of all callers give up rather than wait one possible reason for the lack in patience ms diemont says is the fact that more customers are calling on the move using their mobile phones the surge in customers trying to get through to call centres is also a reflection of the centres growing range of tasks once a call centre may have looked after mortgages now its agents may also be responsible for credit cards insurance and current accounts ms diemont says problems are occurring because increased responsibility is not going hand in hand with more training the survey found in what dimension data calls an alarming development the average induction time for a call centre worker fell last year from 36 to just 21 days leaving agents not equipped to deal with customers this ms diemont warns is scary and not good for the bottom line either poor training frustrates both call centre workers and customers as a result call centres have a high churn rate with nearly a quarter of workers throwing in the towel every year which in turn forces companies to pay for training new staff resolution rates the number of calls where a customer s query is resolved to mutual satisfaction are running at just 50 when the query is passed on to a second or third person a specialist or manager rates rise to about 70 but that is still well below the industry target of an 85 resolution rate suggestions that outsourcing relocating call centres to low cost countries like india or south africa is to blame are wrong ms diemont says there are no big differences in wait time and call resolution between call centres based in europe or north america and those in developing countries around the world you can make call centres perform anywhere if you have good management and the right processes in place she says however companies that decide to offshore their operations are driven not just by cost considerations only 42 of them say that saving money is the main consideration when closing domestic call centre operations half of them argue that workers in other countries offer better skills for the money but not everybody believes that outsourcing and offshoring are the solution nearly two thirds of all firms polled for the survey have no plans to offshore their call centres they give three key reasons for not making the move call centre operations are part of their business core function they are worried about the risk of going abroad they fear that they will damage their brand if they join the offshoring drive the survey was conducted by sunovate on behalf of dimension data and is based on in depth questionnaires of 166 call centres in 24 countries and five continents what are your experiences with call centres are you happy to listen to vivaldi or greensleeves or do you want an immediate response and if you work in a call centre did your training prepare you for your job

1,economy strong in election year uk businesses are set to prosper during the next few months but this could trigger more interest rate rises according to a report optimism is at its highest since 1997 and business will reap the benefits of a continuing rise in public spending say researchers at bdo stoy hayward the bank of england is expected to keep rates on hold this week but they could go up later in the year rates are likely to rise after the anticipated general election in may the bdo optimism index a leading indicator of gdp growth two quarters ahead edged up in january to 102 5 from 102 2 in october the rise is due in part to an increase in public spending and increased merger and acquisition activity the only thing blighting business optimism this year will be uncertainties associated with the general election bdo said its bdo s output index which predicts gdp movements a quarter in advance remained at 100 8 for january implying gdp growth at 2 9 in the second quarter of 2005 however the output index is being held back by recent interest rate rises sterling s strength against the dollar and high oil prices the group noted its inflation index which has risen continuously over the last 8 months climbed to 110 0 in january from 108 0 in october last year the uk is looking strong going into the general election but businesses need to prepare themselves for a jolt ahead as the bank of england reacts to growth and inflationary pressures said peter hemington partner at bdo stoy hayward growth will probably slow by the end of 2005 and it is likely that we will see higher interest rates or a sharp drop in demand for products and services
4,will the budget bring out smiling voters as tory spokesman oliver letwin said any chancellor would use his pre election budget to offer some vote winning sweeteners wouldn t he and everyone does indeed expect gordon brown to do just that in his last budget before the expected polling day of 5 may there will be plenty of talk about taking no risks with the economy or handing out irresponsible giveaways but mr brown will stun westminster and break just about every historical precedent if he fails to do something designed to put a smile on voters faces and make them more inclined to back labour in the election and there has already been speculation about possible tax reductions for the poorest and increasing the threshold on stamp duty in this week s budget the aim of his package will be to keep any disillusioned core labour voters in the fold while ensuring the middle england voters who gave tony blair two election victories don t desert him at the third poll and needless to say there will be plenty of analysis of what impact the budget will have on mr brown s own ambitions to replace mr blair as prime minister at some point after a third win but there is a shadow hanging over this pre election performance in the shape of 11 billion or thereabouts that is the size of the financial black hole the tories backed by some independent forecasters believe mr brown will have to fill with tax increases after the election the opening shot in that battle was fired at the weekend with claims a treasury leak suggested mr brown was ready to slap capital gains tax on home sales to raise some of that cash it was immediately denied but the tories remain suspicious claiming that as mr letwin said if the money does not come from there where will it come from mr brown will undoubtedly claim the forecasts are simply wrong and that he will have absolutely no need to raise taxes after the election should labour win previous gloomy forecasts proved wrong he will argue while suggesting that only by sticking with him can britain continue to have a sound economy low unemployment and high public spending the opposition will reject that by claiming they can keep the economy sound increase spending and cut taxes at the same time the liberal democrats will also promise to run a sound economy but based on increased taxes to fund spending and amongst other things abolishing the council tax in favour of a local income tax and there will be prolonged argument over which of the parties can make the greatest savings in whitehall and beyond to fund their policies but probably what that all boils down to is a simple question of which of the parties the voters most trust to keep the economy stable and avoid any unpleasant surprises in the coming years and it is probably still the answer to that one question that will overwhelmingly decide the outcome of the general election

1,the ticking budget facing the us the budget proposals laid out by the administration of us president george w bush are highly controversial the washington based economic policy institute which tends to be critical of the president looks at possible fault lines us politicians and citizens of all political persuasions are in for a dose of shock therapy without major changes in current policies and political prejudices the federal budget simply cannot hold together news coverage of the bush budget will be dominated by debates about spending cuts but the fact is these will be large cuts in small programs from the standpoint of the big fiscal trends the cuts are gratuitous and the big budget train wreck is yet to come under direct threat will be the federal government s ability to make good on its debts to the social security trust fund as soon as 2018 the fund will begin to require some cash returns on its bond holdings in order to finance all promised benefits the trigger for the coming shock will be rising federal debt which will grow in 10 years by conservative estimates to more than half the nation s total annual output this upward trend will force increased borrowing by the federal government putting upward pressure on interest rates faced by consumers and business even now a growing share of us borrowing is from abroad the us government cannot finance its operations without heavy borrowing from the central banks of japan and china among other nations this does not bode well for us influence in the world the decline of the dollar is a warning sign that current economic trends cannot continue the dollar is already sinking before too long credit markets are likely to react and interest rates will creep upwards that will be the shock interest sensitive industries will feel pain immediately sectors such as housing automobiles other consumer durables agriculture and small business some will recall the news footage of angry farmers driving their heavy equipment around the us capitol in the late 1970s there will be no need for constitutional amendments to balance the budget the public outcry will force congress to act whether it will act wisely is another matter how did this happen by definition the deficit means too little revenue and too much spending but this neutral description doesn t adequately capture the current situation federal revenues are at 1950s levels while spending remains where it has been in recent decades much higher in addition the united states has two significant military missions the bush administration s chosen remedy is the least feasible one reducing domestic spending or eliminating waste fraud and abuse is toothless because this slice of the budget is too small to solve the problem indeed if congress were rash enough to balance the budget in this way there would hardly be any such spending left law enforcement space exploration environmental clean up economic development the small business administration housing veterans benefits aid to state and local governments would all but disappear it s fantasy to think these routine government functions could be slashed the biggest spending growth areas are defence including homeland security and health care for the elderly and the poor to some extent increases in these areas are inevitable the us population is aging and the nation does face genuine threats in the world but serious savings can only be found where the big money is savings in health care spending that do not come at the expense of health can only be achieved with wholesale reform of the entire system public and private brute force budget cuts or spending caps would ill serve the nation s elderly and indigent on the revenue side the lion s share of revenue lost to tax cuts enacted since 2000 will have to be replaced some rearranging could hold many people harmless and focus most of the pain on those with relatively high incomes finally blind allegiance to a balanced budget will have to be abandoned there is no good reason to fixate on it anyway moderate deficits and slowly rising federal debt can be sustained indefinitely borrowing for investments in education and infrastructure that pay off in future years makes sense the sooner we face that reality the sooner workable reforms can be pursued first on the list should be tax reform to raise revenue simplify the tax code and restore some fairness eroded by the bush tax cuts second should be a dispassionate re evaluation of the huge increase in defence spending over the past three years much of it unrelated to afghanistan iraq or terrorism third must be the start of a serious debate on large scale health care reform one thing is certain destroying the budget in order to save it is not going to equip the us economy and government for the challenges of this new century

4,mps murder sentence concern murder sentences should not be reduced automatically simply because of a guilty plea says a new mps report the influential commons home affairs committee was responding to sentencing guidelines issued this summer the mps also call for tougher sentences for crimes committed under the influence of drink or drugs they say the influence of drugs and alcohol should be introduced as an aggravating factor when judges and magistrates sentence offenders committee chairman john denham said drugs of alcohol were sometimes used as an excuse the committee believes that these arguments should be rejected by sentencers and that being under their influence should instead be an aggravating factor at present judges when sentencing murderers to the mandatory life sentence can reduce the tariff the minimum term they must serve if the defendant pleads guilty but although they are spared the ordeal of a trial many murder victims relatives are unhappy in july this year amanda champion s killer james ford pleaded guilty to her murder and was jailed for at least 15 years it would have been longer had he denied the charge amanda s uncle lewis champion told the bbc news website ford did not deserve any credit for his plea saying nothing at all is worth taking five years off a murder sentence mps criticised home secretary david blunkett last year for introducing last minute rules allowing reduced sentences for murderers who pleaded guilty the measures passed into law virtually unnoticed after mr blunkett introduced them at a late stage of the criminal justice bill as a result says the committee the government may need to re legislate to remove ambiguity over how murderers should be sentenced it is also calling on the senior judge in england and wales lord woolf to abandon draft guidelines he proposed in september to reduce sentences of murderers who plead guilty the committee said the plans had not reflected the public disquiet expressed over the possibility of significantly reduced prison terms for murderers lord woolf s sentencing guidelines council sgc caused further controversy by suggesting a one third discount off sentences for early guilty pleas in all types of crime as a result murderers who face a 15 year tariff could get five years knocked off if they give themselves up to the police mr denham believes the sgc should reconsider its proposals to reflect parliament s wish that murder should be treated as a separate and especially grave category of offence he said we want to see sentencers advised that in the case of murder reduction in sentence for a guilty plea should not normally be granted in addition to reductions for other mitigating circumstances but a spokesman for the home office defended the proposals he said by making express provision for murder tariffs in the criminal justice act parliament sent a clear signal that it expects murder to be treated differently to other offences we stand by the provisions in the act that cover guilty plea discounts which have potential benefits for victims and witnesses of avoiding the trauma of a trial shadow home secretary david davis echoed criticisms of the way mr blunkett introduced the murder tariff rules there is genuine concern about potential reductions in murder sentences such action sends out the wrong signals to violent criminals and completely undermines the government s claim to be tough on crime he said but liberal democrat spokesman mark oaten warned the mps committee that binding judges too much might look like political interference the danger of having a prescriptive approach is that whilst every murder is awful it is also different he told bbc news

4,act on detention ruling uk urged the government must act quickly on the law lords ruling that detention of foreign terror suspects without trial is unlawful mary robinson has said the former un commissioner for human rights and irish president told radio 4 s today the government s response would be scrutinised internationally it would be very troubling if the government did not accept the judgement and then work within it she said home secretary charles clarke has said detainees will not be freed at present speaking to parliament on his first day in office as home secretary following david blunkett s resignation mr clarke said i will be asking parliament to renew this legislation in the new year in the meantime we will be studying the judgement carefully to see whether it is possible to modify our legislation to address the concerns raised by the house of lords mrs robinson said the law lords ruling was in line with international legal opinion and praised their very decisive eight to one majority what the law lords did was acknowledge the role of the government but say that there had been a disproportionate use that it amounted to executive detention and it was discriminatory because it didn t apply to british citizens she said mrs robinson warned that a lack of action by the british government could lead to further action in legal arenas such as the european court of human rights in strasbourg if the government were not to accept this ruling then there is further redress including possible damages for the individuals who could claim that the government either was tardy or was resisting the implications of the judgement of the law lords she said a meeting of the club of madrid a group of former world leaders to be held in the spanish capital on the march anniversary of the train bombings there would probably discuss the ruling and its implications i have no doubt that this judgement will be looked at both as a very positive step in clarifying the law and restating the fundamental principles but also the response of the british government will be under quite a clear international scrutiny there the detainees took their case to the house of lords after the court of appeal backed the home office s powers to hold them without limit or charge the government opted out of part of the european convention on human rights concerning the right to a fair trial in order to bring in anti terrorism legislation in response to the 11 september attacks in the us any foreign national suspected of links with terrorism can be detained or can opt to be deported the law lords said the rules were incompatible with the european convention on human rights as they allowed detentions in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status the case was heard by a panel of nine law lords rather than the usual five because of the constitutional importance of the case

4,top judge clashes with ministers the uk s top judge has revealed he has clashed with ministers about how the heads of public inquiries are chosen lord woolf said he was determined his current veto on whether a judge should chair an inquiry should continue as a guard for judicial independence but he told mps the lord chancellor lord falconer was insisting he should have the final say in such cases lord hutton s inquiry into the death of dr david kelly sparked debate about who should run inquiries the government says the lord chancellor would be unlikely to go against lord woolf s wishes lord woolf who is lord chief justice of england and wales was giving evidence to the commons public administration select committee s inquiry into public inquiries he said he had not been involved in the choice of lord hutton who as a law lord did not come under his jurisdiction but he argued he should have a veto on whether judges generally should chair a particular inquiry and if so which judge it should be in written evidence to the committee lord woolf said i have so far failed to reach an agreement with the lord chancellor on this issue i intend to maintain my position and will press for this safeguard to be in any future legislation judges should think carefully before heading an inquiry into a highly political issue such as the intelligence on iraq s weapons of mass destruction he said he argued the subject matter of the inquiry may be so political that it would be damaging to the judiciary for a judge to be involved in addition the question of whether there should be an inquiry at all may be highly controversial and if a judge is appointed the judiciary as a result of the appointment may be seen as siding inappropriately with the government he told the mps anything that tends to undermine the confidence of the public in the judiciary worries me lord woolf said the current rules were not written down but it was inconceivable in practice that the lord chancellor would overrule his concerns but that situation could change with new legal reforms the issue had been overlooked when a new agreement was drawn up about those responsibilities and the dispute had emerged in later discussions what i am asking for is a situation where if the lord chancellor cannot obtain my agreement on appointing a judge it doesn t happen he said lord woolf said he did not think there would be difficulties but he wanted to establish the principle a department for constitutional affairs spokeswoman said lord woolf and lord falconer agreed about what happened in practice their disagreement is about whether the legislation should include a requirement for consultation or concurrence a very narrow dispute in lord woolf s words she said as lord woolf also acknowledged it is highly unlikely that the lord chancellor would appoint a judge against the wishes of the lord chief justice judges are free to decide for themselves whether to accept positions as inquiry chairs parliament will examine the issue next year when it debates a new bill about public inquiries

4,bid to cut court witness stress new targets to reduce the stress to victims and witnesses giving evidence in courts in england and wales have been announced by the lord chancellor lord falconer wants all crown courts and 90 of magistrates courts to have facilities to keep witnesses separate from defendants within four years more video links will also be made available so that witnesses do not have to enter courtrooms it is part of a five year plan to help build confidence in the justice system ministers say the strategy is aimed at re balancing the court system towards victims and increasing the number of offenders brought to justice launching the department for constitutional affairs plan lord falconer said one of the top priorities will be a better deal for victims the needs and safety of victims will be at the heart of the way trials are managed courts judges magistrates prosecutors police and victim support all working together to ensure the rights of victims are put first without compromising the rights of the defendant he went on giving evidence is a nerve wracking experience especially when you re a victim yet with a will and with support it can be done lord falconer told bbc radio 4 s today programme it was impossible for some elderly people to go to court to give evidence other witnesses could be intimidated by sitting alongside defendants outside courts you are never going to get rid of some element of the trauma of giving evidence he said but you can make people believe that the courts understand the problem it s not some kind of alien place where they go where they are not thinking about them the plan comes as the lord chancellor also considers allowing cameras into courts for the first time since 1925 as long as they were used for cases that did not involve witnesses another feature of the strategy is constitutional reform with a government bill to set up a supreme court and a judicial appointments commission returning to the house of lords on tuesday ministers had proposed getting rid of the title of lord chancellor but the lords have over ruled this lord falconer said it was right for the highest court to be completely distinct from parliament the person in charge of the court system should not also be speaker of the house of lords he said and should be the best person chosen from either house of parliament what they did not what they were called was the critical issue he added
0,who do you think you are the real danger is not what happens to your data as it crosses the net argues analyst bill thompson it is what happens when it arrives at the other end the financial services authority has warned banks and other financial institutions that members of criminal gangs may be applying for jobs which give them access to confidential customer data the fear is not that they will steal money from our bank accounts but that they will instead steal something far more valuable in our digital society our identities armed with the personal details that a bank holds plus a fake letter or two it is apparently easy to get a loan open a bank account with an overdraft or get a credit card in someone else s name and it is then a simple matter to move the money into another account and leave the unwitting victim to sort out the mess when statements and demands for payment start arriving identity theft is an increasingly significant economic crime and we are all becoming more aware of the dangers of leaving bills receipts and bank statements unshredded in our rubbish but however careful you may be if the organisations you trust with your personal data bank accounts and credit cards are not able to look after their databases properly then you are in trouble it is surprising that it has taken the gangs so long to realise that a well placed insider is by far the simplest way to break the security of a computer system in fact i suspect that the fsa is probably very late to this particular party and that this sort of thing has been going on for rather a long time has anyone checked bob cratchit s family links to the criminal underworld i wonder and it is hardly likely to be only banks that are being targeted health authorities government agencies and of course the big e commerce sites like amazon must also offer rich pickings for the fraudsters the good news is that better auditing is likely to catch out those who access account details that they are not supposed to and as we all become aware of the danger of identity theft and look more carefully for unexpected transactions on our statements banks should have good enough records and logs to trace the people who might have accessed the account details fortunately there are now ways to keep bank systems more secure from the sort of data theft that involves taking a portable hard drive or flash memory card into the office plugging it into a usb slot and sucking down customer files companies like securewave for example can restrict the use of usb ports just to authorised devices or even to an individual s personal memory card these solutions are not perfect but it does not feel like a wave of fraud is about to wash away the entire financial system however the warning does highlight one of the major issues with e commerce and online trading the security or otherwise of the servers and other systems that make up the back office it has been clear for years that the real danger in paying for goods online with a credit card is not that the number will be intercepted in transit but that the shop you are dealing with will be hacked in fact i do not know of a single case where an e mail containing payment details has led to card fraud there are simply too many e mails passing over the net for interception to be a sensible tool for anyone out to commit fraud cd universe powergen and many other companies have left their databases open and suffered the consequences and just last week the online bank cahoot admitted that its customer account details could be read by anyone who could guess a login name whether it is external hackers breaking in because of poor system security or internal staff abusing the access they get as part of their job the issue is the same how do we make sure that our personal data is not abused any organisation that processes personal data is of course bound by the data protection act and must take proper care of it unauthorised disclosure is not allowed but the penalties are small and the process of prosecuting under the act so convoluted as to be worthless in practice this is not something we can just leave it to the market the consequences of having one s identity stolen are too serious and markets respond too slowly after all i bank with cahoot but it would be so much hassle to move my accounts that i did not even consider it when i heard about their security problems i doubt many others have closed their accounts especially when there is little guarantee that other banks are not going to make the same sort of mistake in future the two options would seem to be more stringent data protection law so that companies really feel the pressure to improve their internal processes or a wave of civil lawsuits against financial institutions with sloppy practices whose customers suffer from identity theft i have never felt comfortable with the us practice of suing everything that moves partly because it seems to make lawyers richer than their clients so i know which i d prefer bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital

1,giant waves damage s asia economy governments aid agencies insurers and travel firms are among those counting the cost of the massive earthquake and waves that hammered southern asia the worst hit areas are sri lanka india indonesia and thailand with at least 23 000 people killed early estimates from the world bank put the amount of aid needed at about 5bn 2 6bn similar to the cash offered central america after hurricane mitch mitch killed about 10 000 people and caused damage of about 10bn in 1998 world bank spokesman damien milverton told the wall street journal that he expected an aid package of financing and debt relief tourism is a vital part of the economies of the stricken countries providing jobs for 19 million people in the south east asian region according to the world travel and tourism council wttc in the maldives islands in the indian ocean two thirds of all jobs depend on tourism but the damage covers fishing farming and businesses too with hundreds of thousands of buildings and small boats destroyed by the waves international agencies have pledged their support most say it is impossible to gauge the extent of the damage yet the international monetary fund imf has promised rapid action to help the governments of the stricken countries cope the imf stands ready to do its part to assist these nations with appropriate support in their time of need said managing director rodrigo rato only sri lanka and bangladesh currently receive imf support while indonesia the quake s epicentre has recently graduated from imf assistance it is up to governments to decide if they want imf help other agencies such as the asian development bank have said that it is too early to comment on the amount of aid needed there is no underestimating the size of the problem however the united nations emergency relief coordinator jan egeland said that this may be the worst national disaster in recent history because it is affecting so many heavily populated coastal areas so many vulnerable communities many people will have had their livelihoods their whole future destroyed in a few seconds he warned that the longer term effects many be as devastating as the tidal wave or the tsunami itself because of the risks of epidemics from polluted drinking water insurers are also struggling to assess the cost of the damage but several big players believe the final bill is likely to be less than the 27bn cost of the hurricanes that battered the us earlier this year the region that s affected is very big so we have to check country by country what the situation is said serge troeber deputy head of the natural disasters department at swiss re the world s second biggest reinsurance firm i should assume however that the overall dimension of insured damages is below the storm damages of the us he said munich re the world s biggest reinsurer said this is primarily a human tragedy it is too early for us to state what our financial burden will be allianz has said it sees no significant impact on its profitability however a low insurance bill may simply reflect the general poverty of much of the region rather than the level of economic devastation for those who live there the international federation of the red cross and red crescent societies told the reuters news agency that it was seeking 6 5m for emergency aid the biggest health challenges we face is the spread of waterborne diseases particularly malaria and diarrhoea the aid agency was quoted as saying the european union has said it will deliver 3m euros 2 1m 4 1m of aid according to the wall street journal the eu s humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel was quoted as saying that it was key to bring aid in those vital hours and days immediately after the disaster other countries also are reported to have pledged cash while the us state department said it was examining what aid was needed in the region getting companies and business up and running also may play a vital role in helping communities recover from the weekend s events many of the worst hit areas such as sri lanka thailand s phuket island and the maldives are popular tourist resorts that are key to local economies december and january are two of the busiest months for the travel in southern asia and the damage will be even more keenly felt as the industry was only just beginning to emerge from a post 9 11 slump growth has been rapid in southeast asia with the world tourism organisation figures showing a 45 increase in tourist revenues in the region during the first 10 months of 2004 in southern asia that expansion is 23 india continues to post excellent results thanks to increased promotion and product development but also to the upsurge in business travel driven by the rapid economic development of the country the wto said arrivals to other destinations such as maldives and sri lanka also thrived in thailand tourism accounts for about 6 of the country s annual gross domestic product or about 8bn in singapore the figure is close to 5 tourism also brings in much needed foreign currency in the short term however travel companies are cancelling flights and trips that has hit shares across asia and europe with investors saying that earnings and economic growth are likely to slow
2,moore questions captaincy brian moore believes the england captain should not be a full back jason robinson has led the team during their opening three defeats in the six nations tournament in the absence of fly half jonny wilkinson the world champions have struggled since the retirement of former captain martin johnson a lock forward and former england captain moore told the bbc full backs are too far away from the action that s not a reflection on robinson personally he added i just think the point of influence needs to move closer to the pack which is after all where games usually start and finish moore says a lack of cohesion in the forwards is one of the reasons why england have lost against wales france and ireland in this year s tournament assertiveness in the pack isn t there we re not getting enough people into the breakdowns he explained wer e not getting quick ball which means the backs are being stifled their creativity depends on quick ball and we re not getting that with injuries depriving him of key players like wilkinson coach andy robinson has given youngsters such as harry ellis and jamie noon a chance and moore believes the last two games against italy and scotland are a good opportunity to experiment further the problem is the players that are around to replace the icons which have been lost because of retirement and injury don t have the requisite experience moore added you can t do anything about that but play them there are players who have been knocking on the door it s time for them to be looked at in these last two games because there s nothing on them we then go into next season with a greater certainty of who can and cannot handle the pressure of international rugby
0,what price for trusted pc security you can now buy trusted computers but can we really trust the pc vendors asks technology analyst bill thompson if you have recently bought an ibm thinkvantage computer a dell optiplex or one of a whole range of laptops from toshiba hp compaq or samsung then you may have got more for your money than you realised inside your shiny new pc is an extra chip called the trusted platform module tpm that can be used for a range of hardware based security features eventually the tpm will be built into the main processor itself and if the trusted computing group has its way then you will find one in every piece of hardware you own from mobile phones to tv set top boxes to children s toys but for the moment it is a separate piece of hardware providing enhanced security features to programs that know how to use them and as part of a well designed network system it can provide a lot more security than we enjoy today a big advantage of the tpm is that it is hardware based at the moment most of us rely on software to keep our information safe and secure it might be password protected user accounts data encryption programs or a firewall but it all relies on program code running on an inherently insecure processor hardware security is less common even if it is a lot safer this is partly because it is more expensive to give someone a smartcard than a password but also because its more work for users systems administrators and managers as a result we settle for second best so when it comes to computer security trusted systems could be a major step forward after all if you have a laptop that will only run programs that have been digitally signed then it will be a lot harder for virus writers to get their malicious code to run and if all your files are locked automatically then even if you get your computer stolen your personal data will be safeguarded at the moment support for trusted hardware is not built into major operating systems instead you have to use special software like hp s protecttools or wave systems embassy this provides file encryption password management and identity protection usually for business users who connect to company networks full support for the trusted computing specification will not be available from microsoft until the next release of windows longhorn this will include what microsoft in a typical act of obscurantism calls the next generation secure computing base and it will give user level programs access to the trusted computing hardware when that happens we can expect to see a lot of publicity around the new capabilities and no doubt the windows security centre will encourage users to turn on their trusted computing capability just as they turn on their firewall however there is a downside to the increased security from viruses spyware and data theft that this will provide because the trusted computing base is also used to make digital rights management drm systems more secure this will give content providers a lot more control over what we can do with music movies and books that we have bought from them we have seen recently how allowing digital rights management services into our lives can lead to unwelcome consequences users of apple s itunes used to be able to stream the music they had brought to up to five other itunes users a great way of letting your mates discover your music collection but the latest version of itunes limits this capability just as an earlier upgrade reduced the number of times you could burn a selected playlist of purchased songs to a cd another took away the ability to play songs downloaded from real s harmony service on your ipod apple can do this because they wrote the software and they control the rights management once it is embedded in trusted hardware it will be even harder for dedicated programmers to find their way around these restrictions and give us back the fair use rights that should be guaranteed under copyright law similarly users of tivo digital video recorders have found that they cannot record some shows and other programmes that they have recorded are automatically deleted after a day this happens because of changes that tivo have made to their software and the users cannot control it one wonders whether hardware based drm will work for those who believe that locking down digital content is a bad idea and that the flexibility of copyright law is something that should be embraced and not taken away it will not work because of the fundamental flaw at the heart of the system in order for the purchaser to view the content it has to be unlocked once it is unlocked then someone somewhere will figure out a way to make a copy of the unlocked version and once an unlocked version leaks onto the network it will be uncontrollable the efforts going into drm would be much better spent building efficient distribution services finding business models that are based on trusting your customers and offering high quality downloads at fair prices what we want is not so much a trusted computing platform as a trusted customer platform the record companies and the film industry need to recognise that most of us most of the time will pay a reasonable amount for good quality material they will benefit more by building a market in which i can share songs with my friends record shows i want to watch later and burn cds for my kids a market which respects the spirit of copyright law and does not seek to replace it by restrictive contracts or end user agreements we need to ensure that trusted computing remains under the control of the users and is not used to take away the freedoms we enjoy today bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital
0,big war games battle it out the arrival of new titles in the popular medal of honor and call of duty franchises leaves fans of wartime battle titles spoilt for choice the acclaimed pc title call of duty has been updated for console formats building on many of the original s elements for its part the long running medal of honor series has added pacific assault to its pc catalogue adapting the console game rising sun call of duty finest hour casts you as a succession of allied soldiers fighting on world war 2 battlefronts including russia and north africa it is a traditional first person viewed game that lets you control just one character in the midst of a unit where cohorts constantly bark orders at you on a near identical note medal of honor pacific assault does all it can to make you feel part of a tight knit team and plum in the middle of all out action its arenas are the war s pacific battles including guadalcanal and pearl harbour you play one character throughout a raw and rather talkative us soldier both games rely on a carefully stage managed structure that keeps things ticking along when this works it is a brilliant device to make you feel part of a story when it does not it is tedious a winning moment is an early scene in pacific assault where you come under attack at the famous us base in hawaii you are first ushered into a gunboat attacking the incoming waves of japanese planes then made to descend into a sinking battleship to rescue crewman before seizing the anti aircraft guns it is one of the finest set pieces ever seen in a video game this notion of shuffling the player along a studiously pre determined path forcibly witnessing a series of pre set moments of action is a perilous business which can make the whole affair feel stilted rather than organic the genius of something like half life 2 is that it skilfully disguises its linear plotting by various means of misdirection this pair of games do not really accomplish that being more concerned with imparting a full on atmospheric experience call of duty comes with a suitably bombastic score and overblown presentation finest hour has a similar determination framing everything in moody wartime music archive footage and lots of reflective voice overs letting you play a number of different roles is an interesting ploy that adds new dimensions to the call of duty endeavour even if it sacrifices the narrative flow somewhat the game s drawback could be said to be its format tastes differ but these wartime shooters often do seem to work better on pc the mouse control is a big reason why along with the sharper graphics a top end computer can muster and the apparent notion that pc games are allowed to get away with a bit more subtlety call of duty on pc was more detailed plot wise and graphically and this new adaptation feels a little rough and ready targeting with the ps2 controller proved tricky not helped by unconvincing collision detection you can shoot an enemy repeatedly with zero question as to your aim yet the bullets will just refuse to hit him checkpoints are so few and far between that when you get shot which happens regularly you are set harshly far back and will find yourself covering vast tracts of scorched earth again and again the game wants to be a challenge and is and many players will like it for that it is as dynamic a battlefield simulator as you will experience and even if it is not as refined as its pc parent the sense of being part of the action is thoroughly impressive both of these games feature military colleagues who are disturbingly bad shots and prone to odd behaviour and in pacific assault in particular their commands and comments are irritatingly meaningless but the teamwork element in titles like this is superficial designed to add atmosphere and camaraderie rather than affect the gameplay mechanics at all of the two games pacific assault gets more things right including little points like auto saving intelligently and having tidier presentation it engages you very well and also looks wonderful making the most of the lush tropical settings that are reminiscent of the glorious far cry although we had to ramp up the settings on a high spec machine to get the most out of them finest hour is by no means bad and it is only because the pc original was so dazzling that this version sometimes feels underwhelming those looking for a wartime game with plenty of atmosphere and a hearty abundance of enemies to shoot will be contented but they will also have a niggling puzzlement as to why it does not break a little more ground rather then just being competent
1,consumers drive french economy france s economic growth accelerated in the last three months of 2004 driven by consumer spending a report shows gross domestic product gdp rose by 0 8 in the fourth quarter compared with the previous three month period the statistical office insee said that expansion pushed annual growth to 2 3 the fastest rate in two years consumer spending was up by 1 2 in the fourth quarter and there also was a rebound in business investment that gave the recovery an extra shove analysts warned that france still was facing challenges and was unlikely to keep expanding at its current pace france still has a strong economic growth said marc toutai an economist at natexis banques populaires but if we check the figures in detail there s a problem consumer spending is still high but french households have spent their savings to consume france can t sustain a high growth rate without an improvement in the job market there s too much of a gap between growth and employment unemployment levels are currently stuck at about 10 and is proving difficult to bring down despite government efforts another worry is that demand in germany and italy two of france s main trading partners is sluggish despite the concerns analysts pointed out that france was outperforming the majority of its european counterparts and that its economy was looking more robust than in previous years as well as strong domestic demand exports climbed by 1 3 in the fourth quarter the biggest increase in foreign sales for a year it s an economic growth that seems well balanced said nicolas claquin an analyst at ccf in the beginning of 2004 growth was mainly driven by consumer spending here it gets contributions from investment and exports though household consumption is still strong but we expect overall economic growth to fall to 2 0 percent in 2005

4,kilroy launches veritas party ex bbc chat show host and east midlands mep robert kilroy silk said he wanted to change the face of british politics as he launched his new party mr kilroy silk who recently quit the uk independence party said our country was being stolen from us by mass immigration he told a london news conference that veritas latin for truth would avoid the old parties lies and spin ukip leader roger knapman says he is glad to see the back of mr kilroy silk mr kilroy silk promised a firm but fair policy on immigration and said they hoped to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election he said veritas would also announce detailed policies on crime tax pensions health and defence over the next few weeks labour campaign spokesman fraser kemp said veritas was joining an already crowded field on the right of british politics on thursday mr kilroy silk is due to announce which constituency he will run in at the next general election that will come amid speculation he has his sights set on defence secretary geoff hoon s ashfield seat he was joined in the new venture by one of ukip s two london assembly members damien hockney who is now veritas deputy leader ukip s chairman petrina holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left mr kilroy silk quit ukip last week after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party he said he was ashamed to be a member of a ukip whose leadership had gone awol after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last june s european elections while ukip has turned its back on the british people i shall not he said i will be standing at the next general election i shall be leading a vigorous campaign for the causes i believe in and unlike the old parties we shall be honest open and straight mr hockney also left ukip saying mr kilroy silk would deliver better as the leader of a eurosceptic party a spokesman for ukip called on mr hockney to quit the london assembly the party asserts that mr hockney has a moral obligation if not a legal one to stand down its leader roger knapman has said he is glad to see the back of mr kilroy silk he has remarkable ability to influence people but sadly after the european election it became clear that he was more interested in the robert kilroy silk party than the uk independence party so it was nice knowing him now goodbye he said ukip officials also argue mr kilroy silk has not been straightforward in attacking the party he once wanted to lead veritas it s the bnp in an expensive suit it s all well and good robert kilroy silk claiming that veritas is a party that doesn t believe in lies and spin but the truth of the matter is its completely useless due to proportional representation there is no chance that veritas will have any chance in claiming power and change the two horse race trend in my opinion this is just a publicity stunt which has just been used as a smoke screen for his anti islamism slurs which got him sacked from the television i think that his views regarding immigration are shared by many it really is time that the uk government ceased to be a paper tiger on this issue in addition as an ashfield constituent i would be more than interested in kilroy silk opposing geoff hoon good to see the parties of the right splintering in the way the parties of the left have always done let s hope kilroy silk ukip and the euro sceptic wing of the tory party all fade further into obscurity so we can have some truth in the debate about europe we benefit enormously from our membership of the eu we need to be at the heart of europe leading it and driving it to where we as a country want to go not running away from it all mouth and trousers a clown trouble is any votes he collects may just end up helping new labour into a third term whatever kilroy silk and ukip do none of their anti european policies have any relevance outside middle england this new party might gain support from right wing england but will have little impact in wales or scotland hopefully this all this fighting within euro sceptic parties will allow them to slip out of the way and get people voting for real political parties which address more than one issue england needs europe to survive and as soon as people realise this the better we can t rely on the usa forever at last an impetus for increasing the likely 40 turn out for the election the electorate is disillusioned with british politics kilroy has one agenda the uk and i ll be voting for him both ukip and rk s are representatives of small mindedness and a lack of vision for the whole of humankind the interests of humanity and the world lie so much beyond the scope of these people s bickering that who in the overall scheme of things really cares about their petty tiff many people believe you kilroy you may even believe yourself but switching horses midstream and then bad mouthing the steed that got you halfway seriously diminishes your credibility the very idea of political parties born out of such negative feelings as euroscepticism or british supremacy is nauseating one can only hope the public recognise these extremists for what they are and shun them at the polls i ve always thought that kilroy silk was a self publicising egotist and this news does absolutely nothing to alter my opinion brilliant about time this country had a plausible party having seen the recent bbc 3 documentary and witnessed the thoroughly disgraceful chauvinistic behaviour of a number of senior ukip figures i can well understand why kilroy silk feels embarrassed to be associated with such people hopefully the ukip members who are interested in the political debate will support his action fantastic news pro europeans now have far less to worry about from the right the conservatives are as confused as they have been since the mid 1990s and the extreme anti europeans are fracturing themselves into splinter groups that split any votes they might get in local european and general elections robert kilroy silk s ego and vanity are his own and his supporters worst enemy as a euro enthusiast i could not be more delighted by kilroy silk s behaviour he took a party that was just building up a head of steam and having exposed it to ridicule by attempting a coup d etat he is now setting about the serious business of dividing it in two the closer to straight down the middle the better as far as i am concerned but in any eventuality the two sceptic parties will exhaust their energies fighting each other if every politician with ambitions to lead their party resorted to forming their own for that purpose we d have ballot papers a mile long you ve got to hand it to kilroy silk for his sheer arrogance and supreme self belief whilst not being a great fan of kilroy i do agree with his comments about the ukip leadership and like him i am also leaving ukip i believe countless opportunities have been lost to discredit the eu and to show our people what belonging to the eu really means the eu s comments last week about michael howard s plans to reform immigration show how little we govern our own country when they can turn round and say immigration is a matter for the eu and not individual member states the sooner we leave this corrupt super state the better does anyone else think that it is ironic that euro sceptic kilroy silk has used a latin name for his new party rather than a good old british name is this indicative of the man contradictory vain and pompous i think mr kilroy silk has got a very good point british politics has become too pc and as a result has no straight talking honest strong politicians they are all interested in their own careers and not the people who put them in power as a result i feel our democracy is being abused and i want it stopped if mr kilroy silk lives up to half his promises he will get my vote honestly who really cares man with tan leaves party with no plan to set up party with no idea as one of kilroy silk s east midlands constituents i hope those who voted for him are proud to have been taken in by such charming vacuity i feel insulted by having him represent me in the european parliament ukip tried hard to accommodate robert kilroy silk but he made it clear that only control of it would satisfy him someone so keen on complete control was bound to fall foul of ukip s democratic nature kilroy is an able communicator and a capable politician in exactly the way those who lead ukip are not he tried to make it work but they didn t seem to want to grow up he was left in the position of having to defend their gaffes to the media this new party seems a logical next step for kilroy good luck to the man i say oh please this is an amusing irrelevance there is absolutely no chance of either of these parties communicating a sensible and constructive eurosceptic argument they will play a key part in winning the country round to the idea of a reformed more democratic more dynamic europe union future generations will thank him for his ridiculousness the refreshing thing about robert is that he is open honest and straight what other politician can claim this i have a suspicion that he talks for a larger part of the electorate that his critics would like i shall be voting for him the electorate of the east midlands voted not for kilroy silk but for the ukip kilroy silk was made an mep because of his position on the ukip s party list he has no mandate to represent the area and should resign from the european parliament i wouldn t write off kilroy silk while he s a clown and a one man band at the moment he s a populist and that s always dangerous the man clearly has an enormous ego and looking at our current political masters that seems to be one of the factors in success good luck to kilroy though i think he is doing more harm than good for both his new party and ukip because their vote base is not strong enough for both parties to be successful and at the moment ukip have the upper hand while veritas are starting from square one and fighting a somewhat uphill battle the man i once found cringe worthy on day time tv could well turn out to be my country s knight in shining armour he expresses views which are now more than common amongst society today but people are almost too scared to express them kilroy silk has secured my vote and many more like me what s more i look forward to the day when he claims victory wrecks the eu and rescues my great nation without a hair out of place and his tan as perfect as ever great stuff the longer the uk dithers over europe the richer we in ireland become as the only english speaking country fully committed to europe oh and send us over those hard working immigrants our economy needs them this is just what the europhiles pray for as the main eurosceptic party ukip should try to resolve its differences with kilroy to show a united front and give the uk public a serious political voice against europe having multiple parties with the same view point just splits the vote further thank goodness that kilroy silk has gone now ukip at least has a chance in the election it is very sad to see the cause of britain regaining its proper relationship with europe damaged by this split within ukip robert kilroy silk could have a lot to offer instead we have a split party and a damaged cause under the present electoral system people must work together and small parties have no hope of representation last summer ukip achieved a major advance partly and only partly due to kilroy silk it is a great shame this has been dissipated in in fighting ukip has a wide platform of policies not just withdrawal from the eu this kilroy silk conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of his own party neither the english democrats nor the new party were interested in letting him join them and take over their leadership speaks volumes veritas is the beginning of the end for kilroy silk if he believes in truth and democracy then he and the two assembly members should resign and force a by elections to stand on their own platform rather than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then defecting to another so ukip was good enough for him to lead not good enough for him to follow interesting that a party committed to plain speaking should have a latin name every opinion poll points to an overwhelming anti europe feeling in this country kilroy silk could be on the verge of something huge if he can broaden his appeal beyond this one issue he is an extremely able communicator with years of political experience we wants quality schools top hospitals clean and efficient public transport punishments that fit the crime limited asylum a purge on bureaucracy and less taxes it needs courage and honesty two qualities sadly lacking in our politicians kilroy silk may just have those very qualities recruit the right colleagues robert and your time may have come well if you cannot get enough limelight being an ordinary mp then go out and start up your own party it s all flash and no real policy here let s hope this is the start of both ukip and kilroy silk slipping into obscurity veritas the name will doom it but perhaps i am wrong for surely all modern schoolchildren will understand it since they do still learn latin in the classroom do they not the whole essence of what rks represents is euroscepticism so explain to me how the too twee label of veritas symbolises that

2,wenger steps up row arsene wenger has stepped up his feud with sir alex ferguson by claiming the manchester united manager is guilty of bringing football into disrepute the pair s long running row was put back in the headlines on saturday when ferguson said his arsenal counterpart was a disgrace wenger initially refused to bite back saying only i will never answer any questions any more about this man but now he claims ferguson should be punished by the football association the latest twist in the ferguson wenger saga came on saturday when the united boss in an interview with the independent newspaper discussed the events after the game between the two sides in october united won 2 0 that day at old trafford but the game was followed by a now notorious food fight which saw ferguson s clothes covered in soup and pizza the sides meet again at highbury on 1 february in the tunnel wenger was criticising my players calling them cheats so i told him to leave them alone and behave himself ferguson said on saturday he ran at me with hands raised saying what do you want to do about it to not apologise for the behaviour of the players to another manager is unthinkable it s a disgrace but i don t expect wenger to ever apologise he s that type of person those allegations were put to wenger after saturday s game at bolton which arsenal lost to slip 10 points behind chelsea in the title race at first he said only i ve always been consistent with that story and told you nothing happened if he has to talk he talks if he wants to make a newspaper article he makes a newspaper article he doesn t interest me and doesn t matter to me at all i will never answer to any provocation from him any more he does what he likes in england anyway he can go abroad one day and see how it is but later on saturday according to the independent wenger spoke to a smaller group of reporters and expanded on his reaction i have no diplomatic relations with him the arsenal boss is quoted as saying what i don t understand is that he does what he wants and you the press are all at his feet the situation concerning the food fight has been judged and there is a game going on in a month the managers have a responsibility to protect the game before the game but in england you are only punished for what you say after the game now the whole story starts again i don t go into that game we play football i am a football manager and i love football above all no matter what people say reminded that ferguson called him a disgrace wenger added i don t respond to anything in england you have a good phrase it is bringing the game into disrepute but that is not only after a game it is as well before a game ferguson had also claimed that united chief executive david gill and arsenal vice chairman david dein had agreed at boardroom level not to discuss the incident in public but ferguson added in the ensuing weeks all you got was a diatribe from arsenal about being kicked off the pitch and all that nonsense gill phoned dein three times to complain but nothing was done the return is on 1 february and they will come out with another diatribe david gill and i feel we should set the record straight because arsenal have not written to us to apologise and we would not let that happen here meanwhile the league managers association have offered to act as peacemakers in the hope of resolving the on going row during that stormy game in october united striker ruud van nistelrooy caught arsenal s ashley cole with one particularly strong tackle wenger later accused van nistelrooy of cheating and was fined 15 000 and severely reprimanded by the football association ferguson admitted on saturday that van nistelrooy s tackle which earned the dutchman a ban could have given cole a serious injury but he believes arsenal were the main aggressors wenger is always complaining the match was not played in the right spirit he added they are the worst losers of all time they don t know how to lose maybe it is just manchester united they don t lose many games to other teams we tend to forget the worst disciplinary record of all time was arsenal s up until last season in fairness it has improved and now they are seen as paragons of virtue but to wenger it never happens it is all some dream or nightmare
4,kennedy looks to election gains they may not know quite how to describe their position in british politics the real opposition the valid opposition the effective opposition or the authentic opposition but the liberal democrats are entering the expected 2005 election campaign determined to prove it is they not the tories who are now the real threat to labour as tory leader michael howard kicked off his election campaign the lib dem leader charles kennedy dismissed the conservatives as a fading force and he insisted there was no limit to his party s ambitions in the coming poll and he can produce some pretty impressive recent election results to back up his optimism for an election which he believes might just see his party doing big things sensible third party leaders are usually cautious about making any predictions about how they will do come the big test and mr kennedy was not falling into that trap when he fired up his campaign from the party s westminster hq he would make no predictions other than that he expected the lib dems to increase both their votes and their commons seats at the election the gap between labour and the tories was now so narrow as proved he claimed by the defection to labour of robert jackson that only his party offered a genuine alternative on the war on iraq identity cards student fees and the council tax there was nothing to chose between the two big parties whereas the liberal democrats offered costed sensible alternatives he was also happy to break the two party consensus on taxation by promising to increase income tax on those earning more than 100 000 a year to pay for the scrapping of student fees the introduction of free personal care for the elderly and replacing the council tax with a local income tax he was also happy to offer a pledge that he would be doing no deals to prop up either of the other big parties after the election there was a time when such optimistic sounds coming from the third party could be dismissed as self delusion that is no longer the case with the liberal democrats the other parties will still insist that the lib dems are no hopers whose greatest effect on the poll will be to boost the hopes of their opponents by denying them otherwise winnable seats labour in particular fears that disillusioned supporters may switch to the lib dems allowing the tories to win some seats but mr kennedy is clearly hoping for a more significant outcome than that he will not talk about the big breakthrough although there are those who believe this could well be the election that sees his party crossing some sort of symbolic threshold they would argue that by the time of the election after next the liberal democrats may genuinely have replaced the tories as the party challenging labour for power the lib dems will hope to have made advances because of their consistent stand against the war on iraq but mr kennedy believes his new manifesto will also offer sensible costed and achievable policies on things like the council tax crime and asylum that will underpin his claim that his party really is the only opposition worth the name
4,petrol duties frozen brown says chancellor gordon brown has announced a freeze on fuel duty in his pre budget speech to the commons on thursday mr brown told the house that government policy is to raise fuel duty at least in line with inflation each year to fulfil environmental commitments but this financial year because of volatility in the oil market he said the duty would be frozen during 2000 many motorists campaigned against the rises but environmentalists believe less duty means more pollution he said it is our policy that each year fuel duties should rise at least in line with inflation as we seek to meet our targets for reducing polluting emmissions and fund our public services but this financial year because of the sustained volatility in the oil market i propose to match the freeze in car vehicle licence duty with a continuation on the freeze on the main road fuel duties the rac welcomed the news calling it an early christmas present for motorists but the organisation urged drivers to continue to shop around to get the best price for petrol environmental group transport 2000 said the freeze sends the wrong message to motorists we are concerned that although britain leads the world in rhetoric about climate change it often fails in practical action said a spokesman in 2000 the people s fuel lobby caused chaos by blocking roads with slow moving convoys after mr brown threatened to raise fuel taxes the chancellor did not raise duty that year but despite threats of more protests in 2003 he added 1 28p per litre

eight is looking forward to the match he s tough player on any surface he s got a lot of ability he said we had a really tight one in paris that went my way so i m going to need to play well from the outset because he s a dangerous competitor switzerland s federer seeded one is the hot favourite having won three of the four grand slam titles in 2004 he has beaten santoro in five of their seven previous encounters but is taking nothing for granted it s a tricky match federer said i played him at the us open and won quite comfortably then but you never know if the rhythm is a bit off he can keep you guessing and make it difficult the most important thing though is to get used to playing five set matches and winning them the 23 year old could meet four time champion andre agassi in the quarter finals before meeting russian marat safin the player he beat in last year s final eighth seeded american agassi is set to play a qualifier in round one if he can shake off a hip injury which

2,lions blow to world cup stars british and irish lions coach clive woodward says he is unlikely to select any players not involved in next year s rbs six nations championship world cup winners lawrence dallaglio neil back and martin johnson had all been thought to be in the frame for next summer s tour to new zealand i don t think you can ever say never said woodward but i would have to have a compulsive reason to pick any player who is not available to international rugby dallaglio back and johnson have all retired from international rugby over the last 12 months but continue to star for their club sides but woodward added the key thing that i want to stress is that i intend to use the six nations and the players who are available to international rugby as the key benchmark my job along with all the other senior representatives is to make sure that we pick the strongest possible team if you are not playing international rugby then it s still a step up to test rugby it s definitely a disadvantage i think it s absolutely critical and with the history of the lions we have got to take players playing for the four countries woodward also revealed that the race for the captaincy was still wide open it is an open book he said there are some outstanding candidates from all four countries and following the all blacks impressive displays in europe in recent weeks including a 45 6 humiliation of france woodward believes the three test series in new zealand will provide the ultimate rugby challenge their performance in particular against france was simply awesome said the lions coach certain things have been suggested about the potency of their front five but they re a very powerful unit with his customary thoroughness woodward revealed he had taken soundings from australia coach eddie jones and jake white of south africa following their tour matches in britain and ireland as a result woodward stressed his lions group might not be dominated by players from england and ireland and held out hope for the struggling scots scotland s recent results have not been that impressive but there have been some excellent individual performances eddie in particular told me how tough they had made it for australia and i will take on board their opinions and scotland forward simon taylor looks certain to get the call provided he recovers from knee and tendon problems i took lessons from 2001 in that they did make a mistake in taking lawrence dallaglio when he wasn t fit and went on the trip every player has to be looked at on their own merits and simon taylor is an outstanding player and i have no doubts that if he gets back to full fitness he will be on the trip i am told he should be back playing by march and he has plenty of time to prove his fitness for the lions and there are other players like richard hill in the same boat
0,savvy searchers fail to spot ads internet search engine users are an odd mix of naive and sophisticated suggests a report into search habits the report by the us pew research center reveals that 87 of searchers usually find what they were looking for when using a search engine it also shows that few can spot the difference between paid for results and organic ones the report reveals that 84 of net users say they regularly use google ask jeeves msn and yahoo when online almost 50 of those questioned said they would trust search engines much less if they knew information about who paid for results was being hidden according to figures gathered by the pew researchers the average users spends about 43 minutes per month carrying out 34 separate searches and looks at 1 9 webpages for each hunt a significant chunk of net users 36 carry out a search at least weekly and 29 of those asked only look every few weeks for 44 of those questioned the information they are looking for is critical to what they are doing and is information they simply have to find search engine users also tend to be very loyal and once they have found a site they feel they can trust tend to stick with it according to pew research 44 of searchers use just a single search engine 48 use two or three and a small number 7 consult more than three sites tony macklin spokesman for ask jeeves said the results reflected its own research which showed that people use different search engines because the way the sites gather information means they can provide different results for the same query despite this liking for search sites half of those questioned said they could get the same information via other routes a small number 17 said they wouldn t really miss search engines if they did not exist the remaining 33 said they could not live without search sites more than two thirds of those questioned 68 said they thought that the results they were presented with were a fair and unbiased selection of the information on a topic that can be found on the net alongside the growing sophistication of net users is a lack of awareness about paid for results that many search engines provide alongside lists of websites found by indexing the web of those asked 62 were unaware that someone has paid for some of the results they see when they carry out a search only 18 of all searchers say they can tell which results are paid for and which are not said the pew report this finding is ironic since nearly half of all users say they would stop using search engines if they thought engines were not being clear about how they presented paid results commenting mr macklin said sponsored results must be clearly marked and though they might help with some queries user testing showed that people need to be able to spot the difference

3,franz man seeks government help franz ferdinand frontman alex kapranos has called for more government help for musicians while taking part in an edinburgh lectures discussion for any cultural output to thrive there needs to be some kind of state input to that as well he said but kapranos warned against musicians being too closely linked with mps at the university of edinburgh event i think the role of musicians is to question politicians rather than to go to bed with them he said kapranos joined the prestigious lecture series to discuss scotland s role in making 21st century music there are elements of our musical output which require sustenance because they aren t self sufficient he said but so called commercial music would benefit from investment as well he warned musicians against being allied to a particular party however i don t know if having tea with politicians is always a good idea kapranos and his glasgow four piece band have been nominated for five prizes at next week s brit awards including best group and best album their self titled debut album won last year s mercury music prize and spawned three top 20 singles he told the 300 strong audience at the university s reid hall that musicians should listen to a wide range of music and should not be restricted by stereotypes we say i like this because i listen to nirvana and korn i am a troubled individual i m riddled with angst because i listen to chopin and debussy i listen to kylie minogue and scissor sisters because i m upbeat and i like to party i listen to wagner because i like the smell of napalm in the morning kapranos said there was a general hostility towards classical music adding there is very little done to break that hostility other than classic fm he concluded we define ourselves as a nation by the way we encourage our creativity fellow speaker and classical composer james macmillan agreed we need to rediscover our ability to listen previous speakers at the edinburgh lectures series have included former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and author professor stephen hawking kapranos described his appearance on wednesday as more daunting by a long way than their upcoming brits performance i don t really care about the brits he said it s going to be great to go down but i have actually had to exercise part of my brain tonight i think the government should do more to help up and coming artists be discovered by scrapping the entertainment licences for live venues also they should do more to help independent record labels have a louder voice within an industry dominated by commercialised major labels rather than expecting the government i e the taxpayer to fork out why don t some of the megastars put something back in some of britain s wealthiest people are musicians who have raked it in from albums concerts etc there are far more important demands on government funds if they can fund football why not fund music areas of the arts are funded by government and lottery grants so why not music we already have the opera receiving huge grants and it would clearly be beneficial for diversity in music to have the same opportunities in other areas of the music the only problem would be how to judge what merits state cash the government has enough problems funding schools and health services if alex kapranos genuinely thinks a multi billion pound industry should also have government funding then his own education was seriously lacking and more money should be put into that as a scot living in england i appreciate the value of scottish music and culture being a success so i can see no problem with it franz ferdinand travis and snow patrol are just recent examples of the success scottish music can have in the world so we should do what we scots are good at and support our own goods i think the issue is more fundamental should the government be spending money on subsidising a multi million pound industry when health and education are in such a sorry state the answer is most definitely no those people who are lucky enough to pursue their passion to get their pay cheque shouldn t be looking for government subsidies i know that if i was lucky enough to be able to pursue my dream of show jumping i would want to finance myself until i was in a position to pursue corporate sponsorship yes the government should fund music it brings joy to the masses there are already thousands of state funded musicians out there sitting around twiddling their thumbs on the new deal getting the government even more involved would only waste money that could be put to better use as long as the government was funding real talent it would be a great move i would hate to see more pop idol type funding of music though as it would only serve to reinforce the stereotypes that alex talked about only if the proposals make financial sense franz ferdinand must be paying serious amounts of tax on their record sales if they d had a government grant to get started they d have more than paid it back by now so the treasury would be making far more than it paid out however the government has better things to spend its money on than to give charity to everyone who decides they re a musician the government shouldn t fund music it should invest in music and those investments should be treated like any other investment i think the government needs to provide facilities and for young groups and bands to form and practise the equipment is not cheap and can be well beyond the means of many people however i do feel this should be the extent of their role to provide the conditions for the talent to flourish and let it go from there i do agree that the government should help to fund music but there is also a responsibility held by record companies they generally always opt for the tried and tested and tend not to want to break any moulds or risk losing any money which ultimately the directors are in the business for if labels were more willing to put money forward towards smaller breakthrough acts then the government wouldn t have to fork out a great deal yeah why not music should be government funded particularly the work of modern composers and veteran bands artists and stuff pop music pretty much rules the earth so more attention should go to the other fraternities i agree with funding the arts to make it more accessible to the public but i am not convinced that pop music requires financial support from the taxpayer there is a great deal of money generated through pop music perhaps a tax on pop could be ploughed into the public performance of other forms of music for everyone to enjoy perhaps we could financially penalise really bad pop idol style music that is the music industry sector without any artistic merit or originality whatsoever and that which is specifically designed to line the pockets of music producers call it a tax on music pollution if you like though i really like franz ferdinand i have to disagree with mr kapranos once government gets their hand into the private sector it will destroy the creative and possibly controversial avenues the artist pursues many years ago this was the case with the us nea when the government started to question what was considered art for the money they were allotting the solution mr kapranos should pursue would be privately funded organizations like

4,uk heading wrong way says howard tony blair has had the chance to tackle the problems facing britain and has failed michael howard has said britain is heading in the wrong direction the conservative leader said in his new year message mr blair s government was a bossy interfering government that takes decisions that should be made by individuals he added but labour s campaign spokesman fraser kemp responded britain is working don t let the tories wreck it again mr howard also paid tribute to the nation s character for its generous response to the asian quake disaster the catastrophe was overshadowing the hopes for the future at this usually positive time of the year mr howard said we watched the scenes of destruction with a sense of disbelief the scale the speed the ferocity of what happened on boxing day is difficult to grasp yet britain s response has shone a light on our nation s character the last week has shown that the warm caring heart of britain beats as strong as ever he went on to reflect on the values that most britons hold dear looking ahead to the coming general election he pledged to turn these beliefs into reality and set out the choices he says are facing britain how much tax do people want to pay who will give taxpayers value for money the clean hospitals and good disciplined schools they want who can be trusted to get a grip on the disorder on our streets and the chaos in our immigration system mr blair has failed to tackle these problems he claimed saying he has the wrong solution to them the result is big government and higher taxes eroding incentives undermining enterprise and denying people choice worst of all it is a government that has wasted people s money and failed to tackle the problems families face today the tories he said can cut crime and improve public services without asking people to pay more taxes we can have progress without losing what makes britain great its tolerance the respect for the rule of law the ability of everyone to fulfil their potential we simply need to change direction the election will give britain the chance to change this is the record mr blair will have to defend in the coming months he said urging voters to hold him to account but labour spokesman mr kemp said it would be more appropriate for this message to come out on 1 april not 1 january let us never forget that when michael howard was in government britain suffered mass unemployment 15 interest rates record home repossessions and the introduction of the poll tax with labour britain is working rather than alluding to false promises michael howard should be starting 2005 with an apology to the british people for the misery that the government of which he was a member inflicted upon the country

4,minimum wage increased to 5 05 the minimum wage will rise in october benefiting more than 1m people the government has announced adults must be paid at least 5 05 an hour up from 4 85 while 18 to 21 year olds will be paid 4 25 the recommendations came from the low pay commission which said the number of jobs had continued to grow since the minimum wage was introduced in 1999 businesses wanted it frozen warning more rises could damage competitiveness but the unions want a 6 rate a further increase in the adult rate to 5 35 an hour is provisionally scheduled for october 2006 according to the commission many businesses had found the last two significant increases in the minimum wage challenging we have therefore recommended only a slight increase above average earnings and concentrated it in the second year to allow business more time to absorb the impact said chairman adair turner the government says most of those on the minimum wage are women with many working in cleaning catering shops and hairdressing unveiling the latest increase mr blair said he wanted the minimum wage to become a symbol of decency and fairness for too long poverty pay capped the aspiration and prosperity of far too many hard working families he said too often people were told to make a choice between the indignity of unemployment or the humiliation of poverty pay chancellor gordon brown and transport secretary alistair darling promoted the news in edinburgh wales secretary peter hain and welsh first minister rhodri morgan in cardiff and northern ireland minister john spellar in belfast the government has not accepted the commission s recommendation that 21 year olds should be paid at the adult rate but says it will look again at the rate later on mr brown said we want to do nothing that can damage the employment opportunities for young people particularly young people entering the labour market for the first time the government has said it will look at tougher action against the small number of employers who consistently refuse to pay the minimum wage the national minimum wage is currently set at 4 85 per hour for those aged 22 and above and at 4 10 for those aged 18 to 21 a 3 per hour minimum wage was introduced last october for 16 to 17 year olds but apprentices are exempt the trade unions congress welcomed the increase but has called for a 6 minimum wage by next year but the confederation of british industry cbi called for a pause year to assess the impact of the above inflation rise in the minimum wage in october and david frost director of the british chambers of commerce said the level of increase each year has increased by rates far outstripping the rates of inflation what employers are saying to us now is that it s at a level where it s starting to bite into the competitiveness of companies right across the country the liberal democrats economics spokesman vincent cable said he supported the move to raise the minimum wage it s not just good for the workers themselves but it lifts them out of benefits and therefore is good for the exchequer too he said conservative leader michael howard said he accepted the principle of the minimum wage and would not seek to disturb the increase speaking on bbc radio 4 s woman s hour mr howard hinted the tories might go into the general election with a promise to cancel income tax for the lowest paid workers there are people on very low salaries very low incomes indeed who really shouldn t be paying income tax he said it would be better to decrease taxes on earnings below 12 000 a year with say no tax on below 6 000 the losses in tax can be recouped by having a 50pc tax band for people making over 100 000 our minimum wage is going to be effectively almost twice the us minimum wage yet our economy per person is only 2 3rds of the us perhaps we have to really starting questioning why some products cost 50 60 more here than they do in the us this combined with the tax decreases would make the pounds the low paid people do make go much further it s still not good enough i got a part time job at 16 when i was doing my a levels in an attempt to get a little money saved for uni this was only 2 years ago and i was getting paid 2 75 an hour and working as hard as any of the older staff maybe it s about time 16 21 year olds got a fair wage we must remember that the minimum wage is only part of the picture and must not rise to a level that makes employing people unattractive and encourages businesses to send work and therefore jobs abroad still government and local councils employ staff via their contractors that pay at the minimum wage or very close to it an easy way for the government to do as it preaches would be to insist on floor pay levels for all government workers and take tens of thousand of civil servants out of the social security system all together any increase is certainly welcome news however for all those whining about the pressures of an increase in the minimum wage i would simply ask them would you be happy to work for less than 5 05 an hour thought not so then don t expect others to either i can t believe that so many of these comments are against the minimum wage also i personally take great offence at the insinuation that people earning minimum wage were lazy at school if everyone went to university then who would serve you in the supermarkets and clean up after you it s about time that these hardworking people are rewarded with only what they deserve and have earned fair pay and a bit of respect wouldn t go a miss either br gt this is good news the minimum wage has put a sense of equality back into a worker s relationship with their employer wages are supposed to be a fair reflection of an employee s efforts for too long wages were a point of exploitation what could an employer get away with in very simplistic terms this put a pressure to keep low paid wages low with the minimum wage this downward pressure is at least partly removed it is also interesting to read the comments from so called business leaders they are the first to defend the rights and privileges of boards to award fat cat salaries bonuses and pension rights to the select few but they are the first to attack policies that are put in place to merely defend the rights of those that really make those fat cats purr i feel there are both negatives and positives to the increase on one hand some businesses will struggle to stay afloat but on the other hand in today world many young people can t afford to move out as property costs too much and only by earning more will they be able to get on in life its true many may get complacent but the minimum wage could be looked at as more of a stepping stone rather than a hand out here come the usual whines about how difficult it will be for businesses we all remember michael howard s protestations that the minimum wage would cost a million jobs when it was introduced funny how he s gone quiet on that one jobs have continued to increase since this humane legislation was brought in i think if any job is worth doing then it s worth being paid a fair wage for and 5 05 is hardly a fortune if your business cannot pay its workers a decent wage then maybe it s not being run properly and if it folds a better run company will take over its duties and employ more people so everybody wins except incompetent business owners great keep at it tony i remember the despair of the 80s and the low wages employers got away with at last we can make a difference to people and reward them for working we can t afford not to pay a decent wage it s not a jobs at any price economy goodbye sweatshops hello decency the increase in minimum wage is a good thing living in the southwest where house prices and rent have increased hugely like the rest of the country over the past 5 years has made living for you average 18 21 years old very difficult in the south west the increase in living costs have not been matched by an increase in pay for example a job i did in plymouth was underpaid to an equivalent worker in exeter by 75p an hour hopefully the increase in the minimum wage will bring in to balance pay on a regional and national level and in turn allow people like myself who do work hard but might never earn a 6 figure salary the chance to branch out on our own i work at a large hospital where the contractors providing all ancillary services domestic catering portering etc pay the minimum wage of 4 85 as the basic rate someone has to do these unglamorous jobs and earn enough to live decently how dare people suggest we are lazy or complacent for accepting these jobs and these wages who do they think will be carrying out these public service jobs if contractors are allowed to pay as little as their consciences allow this is definitely the right step in the right direction it shows that this government cares for the low income earners as well this is a million votes more good strategy isn t it although i would not deny people the minimum wage increase its timing stinks i am quite prepared for a raft of bribes to come from the government before the election and a raft of taxes afterwards they are playing us for the fools they think we are this is extremely bad news for any business whether they are small and medium enterprises or even large companies by increasing overheads for business there will be an almost certain rise in costs to the consumer who while they openly welcome the idea of an increase in the minimum wage are the same people who still want to buy that shirt or that pair of trainers for next to nothing the extra cost this increase will bring will only be reflected in the price of the goods we buy which in turn will only serve to discourage companies from setting up business in the uk or encourage those companies already based here to look elsewhere the jubilation felt by low paid workers here will soon give way to misery as they lose their jobs this will only lead to a reduction in jobs why have many of the call centre jobs gone to india blair say s the economy is strong and stable economy however consumer debt and the country s debt is at its highest and now they heap this onto businesses that will have no choice but to cut the workforce the timing cannot be coincidental this is blatant electioneering and should be exposed as such andrew in derby complains that raising the minimum wage is blatant electioneering i don t mind if it is in our degraded democracy elections are the one time when elites really have to worry about doing something concrete for the majority my only complaint is the paltry figures being discussed if my maths is right a 35 hour week at 5 05 gives you an annual income just over 9 000 and raising it to 6 leaves it under 11 000 the unions should be putting the government under pressure for much more businesses complaining might like to take a look at corporate pay shareholder payouts and profits before wondering if paying a living wage is really a controlling factor in the viability of their firm i am all for lifting the minimum wage of workers to a reasonable level but we have to accept that with this will come competition from overseas workers also small businesses will have to be able to afford this manpower cost we are already seeing a sweeping change in it work being lost to india where people are paid much less it is difficult for me to understand that only five years ago cheap labour abroad was classified as sweat shop but now we are told it is global competition with our manufacturing industry in serious decline the country cannot be entirely service industries without something tangible to serve there has to be something at the top of the food chain and that is manufacturing the whole picture needs to be looked at this is great news but that might be because i work for minimum wage seems a good idea and will hopefully be an incentive to those who live to claim to actually get a job when you can earn more from claiming than you can from work there is no incentive perhaps a step in the right direction if the tuc get their way a very large number of smes will have to close this will put more people out of work how then will the government fudge the unemployment figures the government know it is not big business that keeps the economy going but the smes but we always get overlooked they will only take notice if these large corporations close and move to other countries after all they are predominantly owned by foreign companies we are a specialist company but with these increases have already had an effect on us and we have lost work another one will close us while i m delighted for those on low pay that this increase is being put forward i am extremely concerned at the implications for small businesses as an employee for a small nursery i know this increase will cause great hardship for my employer who has been unable to increase salaries for higher paid employees because of last october s increase for the lower paid employees who were originally being paid slightly above the minimum but are now on the minimum this latest increase of 20p an hour will cause even more financial hardship if the rate rises to 6 then i can foresee many small businesses having to pay off employees the increase in minimum wage will have a serious effect on my business although we pay above the minimum level we will have to increase our pay rates to maintain the differential the raise is well above inflation and without significant increases in sales it will mean that i will not be taking on a new member of staff as planned and i will be looking to reduce the total hours worked by the other members of staff overtime being the first to go i currently employ 42 staff whose wages mirror the national minimum wage increases above inflation are fine but all of my business is conducted with local authorities who will not accept above inflation rises in my service delivery 80 of my costs are labour the other aspect that is always hidden is that the thresholds for tax credits do not move in line with these increases so that all that happens is that employees tax credit support is reduced by the amount of the increase thereby saving the government money but increasing the financial burden on small to medium businesses it is very good that the government has decided to increase the minimum wage this should hopefully motivate people to undertake the lower status jobs i know about this great idea don t bother getting qualifications laze about at school no need to do anything other than attend so your parents don t get fined because remember when you do eventually start working doesn t matter how lazy you are you ll be guaranteed a decent wage the ones who suffer are the employers i hope that if industry and business have to pay this new rate that mr blair and mr brown will increase tax allowances and raise national insurance thresholds so that the treasury won t take some of this increase off the people they say they are helping or is this just another form of stealth tax on business through the back door i don t believe in the minimum wage at all i think jobs should create their own wage value and that if people want higher wages they should earn them now before everyone thinks that i am some rich kid i can assure you i am not i came from a very much working class background and started work 20 years ago on a youth opportunity program earning 25 per week i worked hard went to college part time got my a levels and degree bettered myself i now earn a 6 figure salary i did that through hard work and getting off my backside a minimum wage just makes people complacent to ashley of swindon when you earned 25 per week it was worth something these days that 25 would need to be near to 60 to have the equivalent buying power i might add that thanks to successive governments holding down the tax allowance threshold below inflation people earning the minimum wage are paying taxes that they never would have done 10 years ago at equivalent wages in my day type arguments are a view that belong in the your day 20 years ago as a graduate working for minimum wage i welcome any increase of pay i can get i disagree with ashley swindon saying i have to work harder to get more pay i have my gcse s a levels and a degree and have chosen to work for a small business that can t afford the wages i should be getting i should be on at least 3x what i m getting but they can t afford it we all work hard but the money is just not there but on the plus side i love my job and wouldn t change it just to get more pay as an employer of staff in several shops the last rise in the minimum wage cost my company an additional 5000 per year these next rises will cost me more i have to get the money from somewhere so pass it on to customers so no one really wins in the end in answer to emma from sleaford regarding no one really wins in the end on the contrary mr blair wins he wins because he obviously has announced this to be a vote winner and his treasury wins because as an employer you will know that the amount of tax and national insurance that the government will receive from all the minimum wage increases will rise and of course not only will be paying out higher wages but as an employer higher employer ni contributions as well if the minimum wage increases again and if it hits anywhere near the 6 00 mark there will be 12 more people on the employment line and one more small business going bankrupt namely mine think of us employers as well mr blair we are not all big corporations earning millions all workers should be entitled to a fair day s pay for a fair day s work how many people on the minimum wage have any hope of obtaining a mortgage or saving towards retirement it is good news for many asians living in uk students who do odd jobs can increase their income and can help there family in their home country i thank mr blair and his government for increase in the national minimum wage

spain lead 1 0 after carlos moya beat mardy fish in straight sets in the opening match of the tie nadal holds his nerve and the crowd goes wild as spain go 2 0 up in the tie roddick holds serve to force nadal to serve for the match but the american surely cannot turn things around now nadal works roddick around the court on two consecutive points to earn two break points one is enough the spaniard secures the double break and roddick is now teetering on the edge roddick is trying to gee himself up but the clay surface is taking its toll on his game and he is looking tired nadal wins the game to love nadal steps up the pressure to break and spain have the early initiative in the fourth set nadal also holds convincingly as both players feel their way into the fourth set roddick shrugs off the disappointment of losing the third set tiebreak and breezes through his first service game of the fourth set nadal earns the first mini break in the tiebreak as the match enters its fourth hour a couple of stunning points follow one where nadal chases down a roddick shot and turns into a passing winner then roddick produces some amazing defence at the net to take the score to 4 4 roddick has two serves for the set but double faults to take the score to 5 5 nadal saves a roddick set point then earns his own with a drive volley and a crosscourt passing winner sends the crowd wild nadal tries to up his aggression and he passes roddick down the line to go 15 40 and two set points up roddick saves the first with a desperate lunge volley and smacks a volley winner across the court to take the score back to deuce before securing the game the set will go to another tiebreak nadal enjoys another straightforward hold and roddick must once again serve to stay in the set roddick again holds on despite some brilliant shot making from his opponent nadal races through his service game to put the pressure straight back onto roddick roddick hangs in on his serve to level matters but nadal is making him fight for every point nadal could be suffering a disappointment hangover from the previous game as he goes 0 30 down and then has to save a break point after a tremendous rally in which he is forced into some brilliant defence but it pays off and the spaniard edges ahead in the set roddick s serve is not firing as ferociously as usual and has to rely on his sheer competitive determination to stay in the set three times nadal forces a break point and three times the world number two hangs in and roddick s grit pays off as he manages to hold roddick still looks a bit sluggish but he attacks the net and is rewarded with a break point which nadal saves with a good first serve and the spaniard goes on to hold there is a disruption in play as roddick is upset about something in the crowd the spanish captain gets involved as does the match referee but it is unclear what the problem is one thing for certain is that the crowd are roused into support of nadal and they go wild when roddick loses the next point and goes break point down roddick saves the break point and then bangs down his ninth ace before clinching the game with a service winner the game passes the two hour mark as nadal holds serve to edge ahead in the third set now roddick has to defend a break point and he produces a characteristic ace to save it it is immediately followed by another and he holds with a little dinked half volley winner roddick is looking a little leaden footed but does carve out a break point for himself but he plays it poorly and nadal avoids the danger roddick has gone off the boil and again struggles he fails to get down properly for a low forehand volley and gives nadal three break points the american blasts an ace to save one but follows up with a double fault and the rubber is level nadal edges towards taking the second set with a comfortable hold two good serves put roddick 30 0 up but he then makes a couple of errors to find himself 30 40 down he saves the break point with an ace and then manages to hold roddick s level has dropped while nadal is on a hot streak the spaniard includes a superb crosscourt winner off the back foot as he races through his service game without dropping a point roddick double faults twice and nadal takes full advantage of the break point offered powering a passing winner past roddick nadal wins another tight game neither player has dipped from the high standard of play in the first set nadal puts the american under pressure and roddick saves a break point with a superb stop volley before going on to hold nadal puts the disappointment of losing the first set tiebreak to claim the opening game in the second roddick double faults to concede the first mini break and then nadal loops a crosscourt winner to seize advantage in the tiebreak he lets one slip but wins his next serve to earn three set points but roddick saves them and then earns one himself nadal comes up with a down the line winner but then nets tamely on roddick s next set point nadal s nerve is tested as he tries to force a tiebreak both players come up with some scintillating tennis and the spaniard has several chances to clinch the game before finally doing so when roddick drives wide a pulsating game sees nadal racing round the court retrieving and refusing to give roddick any easy points the point of the match so far involves roddick s slam dunk smash being returned by nadal before roddick finally manages to end the rally on the very next point nadal blasts a forehand service return from right of court that passes roddick and even the american is forced to applaud but roddick comes up with two big serves to polish off the game nadal outplays roddick to reach 40 0 but the american fights back to 40 30 before nadal s powerful crosscourt forehand winner secures the game the crowd are getting very involved cheering between roddick s first and second serves but the american comes through to hold and edge ahead in the set nadal manages to hold again despite roddick piling the pressure on his serve the spaniard wins the game courtesy of another lucky net cord roddick double faults buts manages to keep his composure a well placed serve is unreturnable and roddick holds a powerful ace down the middle gives nadal a simple love service game the first time he has held serve so far in the match if roddick didn t know before he knows now that he is in a real contest another superb game as nadal breaks to once again lift the roof he produces some fine groundstrokes to leave roddick chasing shadows four of the first five games have seen a break of serve despite the disappointment of losing his serve roddick is not phased and storms into a 40 15 lead when the umpire leaves his seat to confirm a close line call nadal takes the next point but roddick breaks again with a sharp volley at the net roddick s advantage is short lived as nadal breaks back immediately a fortunate net cord helps the spaniard on his way and when roddick fires a forehand cross court shot wide to lose his serve nadal pumps his fist in celebration the american is pumped up for this clash and takes on nadal s serve from the start nadal s drop shot is agonisingly called out and roddick claims the vital first break after moya s win in the opening rubber a raucous seville crowd is buoyed by nadal s impressive start which sees him race into a 30 0 lead however roddick fights back to hold his serve

4,how political squabbles snowball it s become commonplace to argue that blair and brown are like squabbling school kids and that they and their supporters need to grow up and stop bickering but this analysis in fact gets it wrong it s not just children who fight adults do too and there are solid reasons why even a trivial argument between mature protagonists can be hard to stop once its got going the key feature of an endless feud is that everyone can agree they d be better off if it ended but everyone wants to have the last word each participant genuinely wants the row to stop but thinks it worth prolonging the argument just a tiny bit to ensure their view is heard their successive attempts to end the argument with their last word ensure the argument goes on and on and on in the case of mr blair and mr brown successive books are published ensuring the issues never die now this isn t because the participants are stupid it s actually each individual behaving entirely rationally given the incentives facing them indeed there s even a piece of economic theory that explains all this nothing as obscure as post neo classical endogenous growth theory which the chancellor himself once quoted but a ubiquitous piece of game theory which all respectable policy wonks are familiar with it s often referred to as the prisoner s dilemma based on a parable much told in economics degree courses about a sheriff and two prisoners the story goes that two prisoners are jointly charged with a heinous crime and are locked up in separate cells but the sheriff desperately needs a confession from at least one of them to provide enough evidence to convict them of the crime without a confession the prisoners will get a minimal sentence on some trumped up charge clearly the prisoners best strategy is to keep their mouths shut and take the short sentence but the clever sheriff has an idea to induce them to talk he tells each prisoner separately that if they confess and they are the only one to confess they ll be let off their crime and he tells them that if they don t confess and they are the only one not to confess they ll get life now if you are prisoner confronted with this choice your best bet is to confess if your partner doesn t confess you ll get off completely and if your partner does confess you d better confess to ensure you don t get life the result is of course both prisoners confess so the sheriff does not have to let either one off both prisoners individual logic was to behave that way even though both would have been better if they had somehow agreed to shut up don t worry if you don t entirely follow it you can to look it up on google where there are 283 000 entries on it the prisoners dilemma and all its ramifications have truly captured economists in the last couple of decades it is a parable used to describe any situation where there is an obvious sensible choice to be taken collectively but where the only rational choice individually is to behave selfishly a cold war arms race for example a classic case where both russia and america would be better off with just a few arms rather than a lot of arms but as long as each wants just a few more arms than the other an arms race ensues with the results that the individually logical decision to buy more arms results in arms levels that are too high what economics tells us is that once you re in a prisoners dilemma unless you are repeating the experience many times over it s hard to escape the perverse logic of it it s no good just exhorting people to stop buying arms or to stop arguing when all their incentives encourage them to carry on somehow the incentives have to change in the case of the labour party if you believe the rift between blair and brown camps is as bad as the reports suggest solomon s wisdom needs to be deployed to solve the problem every parent knows there are ingenious solutions to arguments solutions which affect the incentives of the participants an example is the famous rule that one divides the other chooses as a way of allocating a piece of cake to be sliced up between greedy children in the case of an apparently endless argument if you want it to come to an end you have to ensure the person who has the last word is one who loses rather than the one who wins the row the cost of prolonging the row by even one more briefing or one more book for that matter has to exceed the benefit of having the last word and getting your point in if the rest of the party can enforce that they ll have the protagonists retreating pretty quickly

4,student fee factor played down a rise has been recorded in the number of students from south of the border applying to universities in scotland however lifelong learning minister jim wallace said that this would not result in scottish students missing out applications from england and wales rose by 17 between january 2005 and the previous year up 23 600 to 27 700 fears had been expressed that a flood of fee refugees would try to avoid top up fees of up to 3 000 a year being introduced in england in june last year mr wallace announced proposals to increase tuition fees for english students studying in scotland by 2 000 in an attempt to prevent a cross border flood although no figure has yet been agreed legislation to introduce the top up fees in england is not due to take effect until autumn 2006 and students who start before then will not have to pay additional fees at all the figures were made public on thursday by admissions service ucas universities scotland which represents university principals claimed that an increase in applications did not amount to scottish students being squeezed out director david caldwell said some students could be applying in an attempt to avoid the possible increase in annual fees at english universities but this was not a major factor he told bbc radio scotland s good morning scotland programme the reason people are opting for scottish universities is that they are perceived as being of very high quality they offer very attractive courses and scotland is seen as a very attractive place to study they know that when they take up their studies in 2006 they will be hit by top up fees if they are going to a university in england and that may be part of the reason why the numbers coming to scotland are so inflated however it does not mean that we will see thousands of additional students from england studying here mr wallace agreed and said the figures had to be looked at in context he explained that when applications were translated into acceptances the number was not huge an additional figure of about 200 also the picture was further blurred by the fact that applications from wales where there are no plans for top up fees have also risen by 19 mr wallace said accepting students from all parts of the world does show the high regard in which scottish higher education is held not just in britain we want to make sure that when students are making their choice they do so on the nature of the course and not because they are under some sort of financial pressure to go to scotland we do not want to have a situation where it becomes impossible for scottish students to get places at scottish universities because we are seen as the cheap option very often the quality of the university experience is enhanced by the fact there are students coming from a wide range of backgrounds so it would be wrong to go the other way and start excluding students

2,ferguson rues failure to cut gap boss sir alex ferguson was left ruing manchester united s failure to close the gap on chelsea everton and arsenal after his side s 1 1 draw with fulham premiership leaders chelsea and the gunners endured a 2 2 stalemate on sunday giving united the chance to make up some ground in the league but ferguson said i think what makes it so bad is that both our rivals dropped points at the weekend it was a great opportunity and we haven t delivered united went ahead through alan smith in the 33rd minute before bouba diop s superb 25 yard strike cancelled out the visitors lead in the 87th minute ferguson described the result as an absolute giveaway after united had earlier missed a host of opportunities to finish off the encounter he said it was a good performance some of the football was fantastic but we just didn t finish them off in fairness it s a fantastic strike from the fulham player the result leaves ferguson s side fourth in the league on 31 points four points behind arsenal and a further five back from chelsea

4,what the election should really be about a general election is the best chance most pressure groups get to make a real impact on government policy here is how six leading lobbies plan to make sure their cause is being debated ahead of an expected spring poll we ve called for the state pension to be increased from 79 60 to the pensioner credit guarantee level of 105 45 that s what we re calling for many pensioners are disadvantaged by the current system if we ve got one in five pensioners below the poverty line we ve got to make it more generous or have these people living in poverty we ve drawn up a pensioners manifesto this will be sent to each of the candidates in the 659 constituencies they will be asked which of the top five issues including the pension issue they would support once we ve got their responses we will publish the results within the constituencies and nationally as well it s our way of putting the politicians on notice we are trying to get across the fact that there are 11m voters over 60 in the country they are more likely to vote than other sections of society and thirdly they are true swing voters before 1997 most pensioners voted conservative in 1997 and 2001 they voted labour but there is no guarantee they will vote for a labour government this time around they cannot take that vote for granted pensions generally will certainly be a big election issue even though the government has postponed the publication of adair turner s full report into the issue he said the uk had one of the least generous pensions systems in the developed world that the government takes seriously the impact of aviation on the environment we haven t worked out specific plans but i imagine we will lobby political parties and incumbent mps various local groups will do that in their particular areas and we will provide a national briefing we don t have any large demonstrations planned but they can t be ruled out it is hard to say whether we will be successful we have got the issue in the public consciousness to an extent but it is difficult to say whether an election will raise its importance in the public mind or whether it will be pushed out by big issues like iraq repealing the hunting bill we are challenging the use of the parliament act 1949 in a high court action we are hoping to hear in the new year whichever way the court rules the other side will appeal so we expect it to fall plumb in electioneering time when the ban comes into force on 18 february we will be going to the european court because no compensation is being paid so there s a lot of legal territory to go we are trying to engage with the ministers by demonstrating and talking whatever intelligence we get we will try to turn up and speak to whoever it is rural affairs minister alun michael has avoided us and cancelled engagements so that makes it difficult it is not intimidatory on the whole it is groups of angry housewives of course there is an element of shouting because people are angry but there is no violence because that does not achieve anything it will fall plumb in the run up to the most important general election tony blair will ever face it s exactly what the prime minister did not want he wanted the issue off the table until after the election people using live animals as targets for sport both here and abroad the reason for including abroad is because of trophy hunting it is another sort of form of shooting for sport the principle is the same whether it s a tiger or a pheasant we will widely publicise what s happening in relation to trophy hunting we will publicise the darker aspects of the target animal industry the uk we will seek to get pledges from individual mps and would be mps saying that they are against the use of animals as targets for sports we would like the support of political parties but i think a general election is very much to do with pledges mps make to their electors with hunting we had many mps who were happy to say they were against it i think what we will get is a very real climbing up the agenda whether or not we will get a ban i am not sure but it will mobilise public opinion everything we do will reduce animal suffering and in time that will lead to a ban the issue that we think is the most important for this election is choice the language of consumerism is very commonplace in government and across the political spectrum choice as an ideology is beginning to be the privatisation of this decade it s become an issue in itself but what s really missing from the debate is the consumer s choice in that choice is not choice at all if all you have to choose from is two failing schools we have seen so many pensions mis selling scandals and in the pensions industry there s a maximum of choice but a minimum quality in that we want choice on the consumer s terms that means clear and accessible information to operate that choice firstly we have our website it features our campaigns and changes every day secondly through our 700 000 members who communicate with us thirdly through the media and also what we will be doing is holding a pre election conference we will invite the opinion formers mps journalists and others the idea is that we open up communications between members of the public and the politicians i think we will be successful it s very much the language being used by the main political parties politicians on all sides are very sensitive to this issue they want to be seen to be responding to this issue fuel duty is a large part of operational costs for road haulage workers we have been hearing about this proposed increase of 1 92p per litre that gordon brown has been postponing and postponing tuppence does not sound like a great deal but every year if you operate one vehicle that s an increase of about 750 if you re running 10 vehicles it s obviously 10 times that if fuel duty does rise we will be absolutely horrified there will be a huge effect throughout the industry and i would not be surprised if you see widespread demonstrations what it will mean is there will be a number of firms going out of business we will continue to do what we have always done we keep the issue in the trade press regrettably it s one of those stories that it is getting harder to get into the national press whatever we do the public don t like lorries they see us as a complaining minority but they don t realise that when you see a car on the road it is probably going to work when you see a lorry it s already at work

4,lawyer attacks anti terror laws a senior barrister who has resigned in protest over the government s anti terror laws says the current system is giving britain a bad name ian macdonald qc quit when the government failed to recognise a house of lords ruling that detaining terror suspects indefinitely is unlawful he was part of a 19 strong panel who have special security clearance to act for suspected terrorists five more barristers are now reported to be threatening to resign mr macdonald told bbc news the reason why i am resigning is because i fundamentally disagree with locking people up without any trial for an indefinite period on reasonable suspicion the current legal system is certainly having a very adverse effect on the muslim community in britain and the whole asian community i think it is giving britain a bad name internationally under the anti terrorism crime and security act introduced by the government in 2001 in response to the 11 september attacks foreign nationals suspected of involvement in terrorism who cannot be deported can be held indefinitely without trial but mr macdonald believes that detainees currently being held should be entitled to a trial by jury my own view is we need to have a full return to trial by jury a proper criminal trial with proper accusations as far as i m concerned the government have to start all over again and rethink their whole strategy for dealing with this he added the attorney general lord goldsmith will receive a letter of resignation from mr macdonald on monday according to the independent his resignation is expected to be followed by those of five other barristers nicholas blake qc andrew nicol qc manjit singh gill qc rick scannell and tom de la mare they are all believed to be carefully considering their positions on the panel of special advocates who represent detainees before the special immigration appeals commission siac a secure court without a jury which tries terror suspects mr macdonald said he had no idea whether further resignations would follow but barry hugill a spokesman for the campaign group liberty told radio 4 s today programme that more lawyers may go i can assure that there is a distinct possibilty that more lawyers may be resigning he said they are now in a situation where everything they have been trained to believe in the right to trial by jury has been abandoned and that is what gives some of them sleepless nights helena kennedy a labour peer and a human rights lawyer said the special advocates main concern was that once they had seen any special intelligence they were not allowed to speak to the detainees when this whole procedure was being considered immediately after 11 september there was a great deal of argument particularly in the house of lords about whether there really was a process that could be considered a judicial review she said without that you are having detention with no habeus corpus and really a blot as ian mcdonald has said on our legal landscape something really quite shocking with regard to the rule of the law

4,lib dems bold election policy charles kennedy has told voters his liberal democrats will offer them an honest choice at the next general election with the other two big parties battling over which will impose the lowest taxes mr kennedy is going into the looming election pledged to increase taxation it is a bold policy and certainly ensures there is that choice between the lib dems and the other two with his party s previous pledge to increase taxes by one penny in the pound to spend on public services already adopted by the government he has switched tack now he is promising to levy a modest increase of the same amount on earnings over 100 000 a year to allow him to finance a series of pledges they are to scrap student fees finance free long term care for the elderly and replace the council tax with a local income tax that last policy will also see about 3 of the most well off paying more while others pensioners in particular will pay less labour and the tories have attacked his policies as both unworkable and not properly costed inevitably they insist there is no need to raise taxes to fund improvements in services the tories claim they can improve services and cut taxes through 35bn efficiency savings while labour has offered 22bn savings but has yet to map out precise tax proposals although there is little chance they will propose increases in many ways the argument between the lib dems and the others over taxation and spending echo the sort of arguments that raged between labour and the tories in the 1980s and early 1990s but unlike the old tory labour debate he believes voters are ready to see modest tax increases on the well off in order to fund improvements in services that is a view partly endorsed by recent polls suggesting people would rather have cash spent on public services than tax cuts similarly there is a different tone to the lib dem approach to asylum and immigration with mr kennedy stressing politicians should not foment an artificial debate about immigration and attacking michael howard s proposals for quotas once again with the two other big parties singing similar songs on immigration mr kennedy is stressing the different more liberal approach of his party mr kennedy was also in buoyant mood over his party s election chances declaring the tories were not going to be significant players in the poll he repeated his pledge not to do post election deals with either party after the election mr kennedy went on to suggest the re election of a labour government with a small majority would amount to a massive vote of no confidence in tony blair s government that suggests the lib dem leader believes he may well find himself in a powerful even pivotal position in a vastly different house of commons after the next election it is a dream the third party has dreamed many times before

sporting passions the game appealed to the kiwi psyche and quickly spread the native maoris finding a particular empathy with the sport s warrior ethos in 1888 a british team led by ae stoddart toured new zealand and australia and soon after a maori named joe warbrick and an english ex pat called thomas eyton decided to gather a combined new zealand team twenty two maori and four pakiha formed the

sivright created animosity in new zealand with his patronising attitude the kiwis shocked the rugby world with a 9 3 triumph in wellington sparking great celebrations across the country but bedell

the tactic was effective two late tries seeing the kiwis to a 12 7 win over scotland before ireland were despatched 15 0 in dublin a huge crowd at crystal palace convulsed with laughter at the sight of the haka but the smiles were soon wiped from their faces when the tourists ran in five tries in a 15 0 hammering of england new zealand headed to wales to meet a country in the midst of its first golden age and the encounter would be the first in a series of controversial clashes between the sides an excellent try on the left wing by teddy morgan sealed a 3 0 win in a hard fought encounter at cardiff arms park but post match talk was dominated by a bob deans try that was ruled out by scottish referee john dallas dallas said that deans was tackled short but the kiwi said he was dragged back into the field of play after grounding a try on his death bed three years later he exclaimed i did score that try in cardiff four of the 1905 all blacks went over to the newly formed all golds rugby league side soon after the tour but new zealand were strong enough to crush an anglo welsh touring team in 1908 the first south africa tour of new zealand in 1921 saw honours shared in a three test series starting the greatest rivalry in rugby and the long running controversy between the countries over the all blacks inclusion of maori players the awesome 1924 5 all black tourists became known as the invincibles after winning all 30 of their games in france britain and ireland including a crushing 19 0 victory over wales at st helen s despite their success the all blacks 2 3 2 scrum formation left them somewhat short of possession at times and the flaws were exploited by the springboks in south africa in 1928 employing the modern 3 4 1 scrum line up against the new zealand rover system for the first time south african teams defeated the all blacks in five games and the test series was drawn two all the controversial new zealand scrum method finally disappeared after the 1930 lions tour a series won 3 1 by new zealand the lions manager describing the tactic as cheating prompting the international rugby board to rule that three men had to pack down in the front row of the scrum the all blacks 1935 european tour started inauspiciously with an 11 3 loss to a swansea side inspired by teenage schoolboy half backs hayden tanner and willie davies a thrilling test at cardiff arms park went to wales 13 12 although the winning try from geoffrey rees jones was controversial following an illegal claude davey tackle in the build up new zealand s next visit to wales in 1953 proved difficult as they lost 8 3 to cardiff and drew 6 6 at swansea the all blacks were on top in the test with wales at the arms park but the teams were locked at 8 8 when a clem thomas cross kick was gathered by ken jones for a famous match winning try the tourists made some amends with wins over the other home nations before a 19 5 success over the barbarians in an arms park thriller new zealand built from that tour and by the time they returned in 1963 4 they were undoubtedly the leading side in the world that made the shock all the greater when a drop goal by student john uzzell gave newport an unlikely 3 0 win over the tourists at rodney parade wilson whinneray s side rallied to beat wales 6 0 their first win at the arms park in four attempts and went unbeaten through the rest of the tour but when they returned home the first question put to them was what happened in newport the only blemish on the record of the awesome 1967 tourists was a draw with east wales as they beat the full wales team 13 6 in cardiff to take the lead in the series between the countries for the first time that lead was increased with two comfortable wins for the home side in new zealand in 1969 the first time wales had toured the country as an independent team a ferocious game at the arms park in 1972 was edged 19 16 by the all blacks a measure of revenge for the defeat inflicted on new zealand by the carwyn james inspired lions of 1971 james guided llanelli to a famous 9 3 win over the tourists at stradey park though and in the final game of the tour the barbarians defeated the all blacks 23 11 in cardiff in a game regarded by many as the greatest ever played new zealand defeated a wales xv 12 3 at the arms park in a non cap game in 1974 but it was the 1978 game in cardiff that would reignite the history of controversy between the two countries wales were leading 12 10 with one minute left when andy haden flew to the floor from a line out television pictures clearly showed that he dived but english referee roger quittenton was fooled and awarded a penalty duly converted by brian mckechnie for a 13 12 win since that infamous game the competition has largely left wales v new zealand fixtures as the men in red have slipped from the pinnacle of the world game a crushing 23 3 win for new zealand in cardiff in the welsh rugby union s 1980 centenary game was a sign of things to come the new professionalism in the southern hemisphere game that had left europe behind was shown as the all blacks swatted wales aside 49 6 in brisbane in the semi final of the inaugural world cup the kiwis went on to claim the cup and would inflict further misery on wales on their ill fated 1988 tour of new zealand a young talented wales side left britain full of confidence as triple crown winners but one of the greatest ever new zealand teams demolished them 52 3 and 54 9 after also taking some fearful beatings in the provincial games wales captain jonathan davies returned home calling for urgent change in the national game but as his views were ignored he along with a generation of wales best players chose to head north to rugby league a 34 9 win in cardiff followed for new zealand in 1989 and at the 1995 world cup wales big talk was made to look embarrassing as the all blacks eased to victory in johannesburg a crushing 42 7 kiwi triumph in wembley followed in 1997 and as wales misery increased they turned to new zealand for their salvation in the shape of coaches graham henry and steve hansen there was a temporary resurgence in the welsh game but when an experimental new zealand side came to cardiff s new millennium stadium in 2002 they left with a 43 17 victory a bruising 55 3 defeat followed for wales in hamilton in 2003 as hansen built towards the world cup but in australia it was a remarkable performance against the all blacks that gave his side renewed hope wales were given no chance going into the game but in the course of the match they rediscovered the value of attacking flair to lead 37 33 early in the second half new zealand rallied to a 53 37 win but the style shown by wales has been used as an inspiration as they look to a better future they now face an all blacks team led by henry and hansen coming to europe with a weakened squad at the end of a long season an encouraging display against south africa has inspired a confident wales camp to believe they can claim their first win over the men in black for over 50 years they have a chance but clearly history is not on their side

brits winners were already established before sound of 2004 was compiled the ceremony will be televised on itv1 on thursday i m speechless best song of the last 25 years yeah right i very much doubt that angels was even the best song of the week that it came out like every track robbie has released as a single it s a blatant but poor facsimile of something that someone else has done better before give us a break best song in 25 years you must be joking its good if you like that sort of thing but really listened to angels on radio 1 this morning when i was driving into work had not heard it for a while i love robs voice the lyrics and tune perfection as usual the public have short memories when it comes to voting for the greatest there must be more than a dozen songs in the last 25 years that deserve this award more it s not exactly groundbreaking presumably the age range that could be bothered to vote is is pretty low i m actually embarrassed to be british if that is the best song we have produced in the last 25 years what about the specials ghost town the buzzcocks ever fallen in love with someone happy mondays kinky afro mcalmont butler yes joy division love will tear us apart angels is middle of the road rubbish angels is a awful piece of sentimental claptrap it s musically and lyrically inept and fantastically overrated a bit like mr williams himself this result isn t very surprising though the brits has a long history of celebrating rubbish music best of the last 25 years maybe cunning to make the timescale not include stairway to heaven or bohemian rhapsody but it does kind of make it a bit of a hollow award really not much competition in the last 25 years after all it s alright for a pop song but the best song of the last 25 years there is no way on earth that song should have been voted the best of the last 25 years it s a travesty rubbish who voted it for it to be included in any list i am a regular listener to radio 2 but i don t recall the invitation to vote for this bland slushy rubbish which might appeal to the masses who wouldn t know a good song if it jumped up and bit them on the nose but is certainly not the best song of the last 25 years how depressing and just when we thought manufactured pop was on the way out where on earth did this dreadful list appear from while i am biassed in that i thought love will tear us apart should have won in all seriousness i think that the best song of the last 25 years should not include songs less than 5 years old as that would exclude songs which are popular because of novelty then again well done robbie good show you ve got to be kidding angels is a great song but not the best song of the last 25 years only the best song to be up for nomination at the brits i think angels is a great song and deserved to be in the run up for this award but i don t think its the best song from the past 25 years right enough it is better than some of the others in this catergory for example what was will young doing being nominated in the first place he is alright but the song isn t that good i m happy for robbie himself though best song in the last 25 years what a joke think of all the great rock and pop songs released in the 80s and pretty much all of them are better than angels phil collins doesn t deserve awards for all the good songs he wrote angels is an overrated song that got tiresome even before you had finished listening to it soppy rubbish at best hopefully manufactured rubbish will die down soon and let the real artists who worked hard for there glory receive awards so boringly obvious and typical of the bland nature of mainstream music in britain today for me it s proof that music and democracy just don t mix still at least it wasn t will young oh it s all just a bit of fun people take these awards too seriously robbie has millions of loyal fans while even non fans know the words to angels him winning obviously reflects who votes in these awards personally i wanted will young to win but that was not really due to his musical talent i hate the song all it brings back is memories of school discos and no one to slow dance with i agree about angels i never get fed up hearing it whenever the song comes on the radio i turn the radio up smile and sing along very badly that is why the radio has to be turned up to drown my voice out the song makes me calm and serene and happy well done robbie i think that although robbie williams is a good performer that angels isn t really that good a song it certainly isn t anywhere near as good as love will tear us apart by joy division or wuthering heights by kate bush angels is a fantastic song all credit to robbie williams and guy chambers it s a song that will be played forever and bridges all age groups robbie did in no way deserve that mantle whenever we have these awards it is always artists from the past five years that seem to win the best of the best we forget about the late 80s and early 90s for example they weren t cool at the time but because they are cool again now shows that the songs have greater longevity than people think yes angels is the best song since the past 25 years because it touches the soul as it carries a lot of meaning i ve always disliked angels intensely i believe it to be symbolic of the general capacity of british pre teens teens and middle aged women to accept low quality low aspirational music as classic songwriting it s orrible it seems obvious to me that people who like robbie are people who don t particularly like music all that much folks without collections folks who have never engaged in that madness one experiences when falling under the spell of pop music angels adds nothing it is merely an irritating distraction a wasp that refuses to go away on a summer s afternoon picnic what a dreadful result if you voted for it you should feel ashamed of yourself you probably only know a dozen songs or so don t you so where do get off applying this uninformed filter and casting this ridiculous vote booo hisss angels best song you are kidding right last five years i might be willing to accept but 25 no way did whoever voted for this actually have any music knowledge prior to say 1995 really quite insulting to the british music industry of the past quarter of a century no surprise about robbie williams considering the list where on earth did the nominations list come from compiled by an eleven year old girl perhaps i mean will young come on what a load of crap best song in the last 25 years i don t think so what about all the real artists out there over the last 25 years the list is endless but robbie williams doesn t even come close what a joke that song has become such a bane to me that i have developed a pavlovian response to the word angels where i thrash around and scream no no no no no until someone tells me the radio s off why a half baked cheesy ditty like angels which has become the anthem for millions of romantic sops think how many times it was sung on pop idol for example and by whom should be voted the best song of the past 25 years is beyond me if this is the song against which all others are judged then musicians may as well give up why do we reward mediocrity so highly in this country the initial list was very weak anyway but angels the best song of the last 25 years i think not i didn t realize radio 2 had so many listeners under the age of 10 people have such short memories a great song yes but the best of the last 25 years not a chance i think the person as opposed to the song has been voted for here the great british public at work again it s a mediocre sentimental and safe song granted it s not too bad either but can it stand up against anything by the smiths in particular how soon is now or anything from the stone roses first album nope no because i m not female and i m not 10 ok i like robbie and angels is a decent song but it is no way the best song of the past 25 years the shortlist wasn t great but him winning it is a joke predictable and laughable the success of angels at this years brits reflects poorly on the state of british music over the last 25 years the british public are brainwashed by the corporate pulp that is presneted to them as cutting edge music and true talent is being sadly missed whilst angels is a popular song it is not even the best song in robbie s repertoire never mind best song of the last 25 years i am a huge robbie fan and love that song but i think there are a lot more outstanding songs music out there that influenced music today unfortunately they were left out of the list have radio 2 listeners even heard of joy division a band who through two albums have had a bigger impact on music and continue to do so over the last 25 years than robbie williams ever will no doubt about it there s not a song done by anyone with more emotion and feeling some people will adopt their slightly snobby stances but angels has hit home with a far larger audience than any other song it should have been joy division those guys have played an influential part in shaping modern day music while angels remains yet another pop song i sincerely do not believe that in 25 years from now the most influential artists will argue that robbie williams inspired their art in the way that the byrds the beatles and nick drake have done for music today yes i think its a brilliantly written song with different meanings to different people there were other great songs in the category but somebody had to win robbie was a deserved winner i am astounded that such a second rate record has beaten such a line up of amazing songs it s a terrible song voted for by the masses who don t have the brains to appreciate innovative and exciting music the best song of the past 25 years really come on this is surely a joke no i think i need a long lie down it just goes to show that the british public do not have a clue about good quality music when they pick robbie williams over the beautifully talented kate bush and joy division i suppose it s confirmed one thing the british public are consistently dull lt no offence robbie but pleeease there must be a thousand better songs than a formulated cheesy pop song for kids no one agrees with this and quite frankly it is an embarassment to the integrity of british music and a further nail in the coffin i think robbie deserves it he has been the most iconic of any stars we have had in britain since john lennon and is an idol to millions worldwide anybody who says he doesn t deserve it is jealous of his success the only real challenger was queen but hey another one bites the dust obviously all the karaoke singers in the uk voted for it if this is the best song of the last 25 years then the british music industry is in trouble sure robbie is talented and produces excellent material but this is not the best record a sad day for music it s not the type of music i normally like but even as a diehard rock fan i recognise that it is a good song and appelas to most people that s why it has been voted best song of the last 25 years it s a good all rounder just like robbie best song in 25 years since 1980 i m confused angels isn t a bad song it s a nice catchy formulaic anthem that ticks all the boxes but this is not great music if anything it s regressive bland even i suppose it s just more evidence of how redundant the brit awards have become granted angels is a good song however it really wasn t up against any other proper competition the queen s song was lackluster and apart from kate bush the other choices were pathetic also why weren t the stones there david bowie etc there are so many greater songs than angels i wonder if it was simply the fact that robbie wasn t getting more awards so they had to make one up for him best song of the last 25 years what a ridiculuous concept and an even more ridiculous winner sigh on the upside at least it wasn t bohemian rhapsody for which we should all be thankful angels is without doubt a great song but i really don t think it deserves the title of best song in 25 years perhaps the vote had more to do with teenage opinion on robbies goodlooks than the actual song don t get me wrong i m not disputing his looks but there are more deserved winners it would have been a travesty had angels not won without angels robbie williams may well not be where he is now and britain would have been deprived of one of its most charismatic and talented performing artists it has to be seen performed live with 125 000 people singing along to be fully appreciated well done rob i find it hard to believe that angels is the best we have to show for the past 25 years i m rapidly redifining best in my own head now to mean most gratuitously played at weddings and funerals because people think it has deep meaning what about britpop blur oasis suede pulp not only making fantastic songs but also making changes doing something different why must best always come down to most commercially popular i ve nothing against robbie i actually like his music but how can this possibly be the best song from the last 25year the brits has proved to be nothing more than a bargaining tool between the pop moguls to boost band profiles and record sales the same goes with the scissor sisters i think this is a superb record and thoroughly deserves the newcomer award but the album comes no where near u2 s new record neither are they in the same league once again there have been some baffling discisions made they are not for artisic reasons but for profit no surprise really it s voted for by the general public since when did they have taste in music personally i find angels by robbie williams to be one of the most irritating songs i have ever heard it absolutely deserved to win it is a song that has united the generations and will continue to be played for many years to come it s an absolute joke however most of the original 25 were very poor choices as well all in all a pretty pointless exercise the song is overplayed and oversentimental out of the rather poor five choices that were left it should have gone to either joy division or queen i suppose we should be thankful that it didn t end up in the hands of will young though although it has nostalgia value there is no way it deserved to win everybody knows the words to bohemian rhapsody nothing compares 2 u etc much better songs and more timeless give it to someone with real talent although angels is a good song i think that anyone with the slightest musical taste will realise that this is not the best song of the last 25 years this is just another example of record company manipulation to keep an artist in the public eye why not give him an award for the greatest pair of trousers if that s all it means
1,egypt to sell off state owned bank the egyptian government is reportedly planning to privatise one of the country s big public banks an investment ministry official has told the reuters news agency that the bank of alexandria will be sold sometime in 2005 the move is seen as evidence of a new commitment by the government to reduce the size of public sector the official said the government has not yet decided whether the sale will take the form of a public flotation the most important thing to decide now is the method whether by selling shares to the public or to a strategic investor from abroad he said analysts say the public sector banks have suited the government s monetary credit and exchange policies nevertheless the egyptian government has spoken for years about privatising one of the big four state banks banque misr national bank of egypt banque du caire and bank of alexandria it had been expected one of the smallest of the four big public banks bank of alexandria or banque du caire would be sold first the announcement reinforces the hopes of investors and international financial bodies for a revival of egypt s privatisation programme about 190 state run companies and facilities were sold off from the early 1990s to 1997 the appointment of mahmoud mohieldin a reform minded technocrat to the new post of investment minister in july was taken as a sign that more sell offs were on the way both the imf and world bank have urged egypt to remove obstacles to the development of the private sector which they say has a vital role to play in reducing poverty by expanding the economy

4,kinnock to urge reform in lords neil kinnock has said his acceptance of a seat in the house of lords will allow him to help achieve further progress with substantial democratic reform on the bbc s breakfast with frost it was put to mr kinnock that he had once referred to lords members as brigands muggers bribers and gangsters but the outgoing european commissioner said his comments made some 26 years ago needed to be put in context he said advocates for reform needed to be inside the lords to vote for it it was pointed out to me that if the additional democratic reform is going to take place it is going to require advocates in the lords and people there willing to vote for it mr kinnock added that the second factor behind his acceptance of the peerage was his appointment as chairman of the british council history demonstrates that it s immensely useful for the british council to have its chairman in the house of lords and that was a conclusive factor mr kinnock said he thought about the decision for quite a long time because he had long had reservations about the lords but he added the process of reform has developed substantially but not sufficiently and consequently i did take all these factors into consideration because it s not a decision to be made glibly the former labour leader said he would probably take the title of lord kinnock of bedwellty his first constituency for which he was selected in 1969

0,rolling out next generation s net the body that oversees how the net works grows and evolves says it has coped well with its growth in the last 10 years but it is just the start in a sense we have hardly started in reaching the whole population the new chair of the internet engineering task force ietf brian carpenter says the ietf ensures the smooth running and organisation of the net s architecture with broadband take up growing services like voice and tv will open up interesting challenges for the net i think voip voice over internet protocol allowing phone calls to be made over the net is very important it challenges all the old cost models of telecoms says dr carpenter second it challenges more deeply the business model that you have to be a service provider with a lot of infrastructure with voip you need very little infrastructure a distinguished ibm engineer dr carpenter spent 20 years at cern the european laboratory for particle physics as the new chair of the ietf his next big challenge is overseeing ipv6 the next generation standard for information transfer and routing across the web at cern dr carpenter helped pioneer advanced net applications during the development of the world wide web so he is well placed to take on such a task the net s growth and evolution depend on standards and protocols and ensuring the architecture works and talks to other standards is a crucial job of the ietf the top priority is to ensure that the standards that make the net work are open and free for anyone to use and work with the net is built on a protocol called tcp ip which means transmission control protocol and internet protocol when computers communicate with the net a unique ip address is used to send and receive information the ietf is a large international community of network designers operators vendors and researchers working on the evolution of the net s architecture and the way this information is sent and received they make sure it all knits together leaving no gaps we ve seen some interesting effects over last few years explains dr carpenter the net was growing at a fantastic rate at the end of the 90s then there was a bit of a glitch in 2000 we are now seeing a very clear phase of consolidation and renewed growth that renewed growth is also being buoyed by emerging economies like china which are showing fast uptake of broadband net and other technologies the number of broadband subscribers via dsl digital subscriber line doubled in a year to 13 million according to figures released at the end of 2004 the challenges we face are about continuing to produce standards to allow for that growth rate explained dr carpenter given it the net was designed for the whole community it has done well to reach millions if you want to reach the whole population you have to make sure it can scale up ipv6 the standard that will replace the existing ipv4 will allow for billions more addresses on the net and it is gradually being worked into network infrastructure across the world the actual number of addresses with ipv4 is limited to four billion ip addresses that clearly is not enough when you have 10 billion people to serve so there is technical solution the new version of ip ipv6 it has much larger address space possibilities with no practical limits said dr carpenter standards are vital to something as complex as the net and making sure standards are open and can work with across networks is a big task the difference this next generation standard ipv6 will make to the average net user is almost invisible our first goal is that it ipv6 should make no difference people should not notice a difference it is like when the london telephone numbers got longer a lot of the process will be invisible people are usually given an ip address without knowing it technically deployment has started and the standards for are just about settled said dr carpenter the one problem with the net that may never disappear completely is security to dr carpenter the solution comes out of technological and human behaviour people have to be educated about sensible behaviour he says such as ignoring e mails that claim you have won something i don t think it is going to get worse people will remain concerned about security and they probably should do just as you would be concerned walking along a dark street we have to do work to make sure there are better security internet standards it is a never ending battle in a sense but he adds even if security has improved you still worry a bit unfortunately it is just part of life we have a duty to do what we can

4,lib dems target first time buyers the liberal democrats have unveiled plans to build 100 000 new affordable homes on publicly owned land the party s scheme would allow people to buy a share in a home through a mutual home ownership trust as a way of getting onto the housing ladder the lib dems would also encourage the conversion of existing buildings in an effort to protect greenfield sites labour has already announced plans to help first time buyers and the tories would extend right to buy schemes all the major parties are focusing on the issue in the run up to the election after a survey suggested first time buyers could not afford a home in 92 of uk towns the lib dems say their mutual homes would let people buy a share of a property usually worth about 5 of the building costs party leader charles kennedy said the homes would be affordable because they would be built on surplus public sector land donated by central or local government people would also only have to pay for the cost of the building and not the land he added they would spend about 30 of their monthly salary on rent and buying extra shares in the property when they moved house they would be able to cash in on any rise in property prices by selling their share it would also allow councils to vary discounts to tenants given the right to buy their council homes so local needs were taken into account mr kennedy said mutual homes will offer people the opportunity to build up an equity stake in a home gradually investing only as much as they can afford there are also plans to prevent high house prices forcing people out of their local communities the kind of golden share used by the lib dems in south shropshire could be rolled out more widely under the plan councils secure deals with developers where they keep a 1 share in a property scheme so properties cannot be sold on the open market instead they are sold at build cost to people who the local council decides have local needs the party says its help for first time buyers can be funded at no extra cost to the taxpayer but the plans involve changing the vat system which the party says often makes it too expensive to renovate existing buildings the conservatives claimed the plans would amount to an extra tax of up to 11 000 on every new house this is typical of lib dem hypocrisy said tory shadow local government secretary caroline spelman they claim that they want to help people on to the property ladder but the small print of their policies reveal how they intend to price even more people out of the housing market the flagship tory proposal on housing policy is to give a million more housing association tenants the right to buy their homes labour has said it will allow 300 000 council and housing association tenants to buy a share in their homes housing minister keith hill said much of the lib dem plans mimicked the government s strategy however as usual the lib dems proposals are completely uncosted he said mr hill said he also asked whether the lib dems would match labour s promise to spend 42bn on making refurbishing and repair council homes by 2010

2,owen set for skipper role wales number eight michael owen says replacing gareth thomas as wales captain will be straightforward because of the leadership quality in the squad you dream about playing for wales but it never enters your head that you will one day captain your country he said it s an easy job really because there are so many experienced players in the side but it will be a massive honour coach mike ruddock says the 24 year old should take the armband from broken thumb victim thomas against scotland ruddock praised owen s contribution as vice captain and pack leader in this year s wins over england italy and france notably his role in the second half in paris following thomas injury the 22 cap dragons man says that thomas will be badly missed though gareth is going to be a massive loss because he is a brilliant player and he has done a fantastic job since he has been captain said owen he has put his own unique stamp on things we are going to miss him but the strength of the squad is shown when you have someone like kevin morgan to step in owen admitted the grand slam had been mentioned within the squad but that no one was getting carried away with the three victories over england italy and france we can t get ahead of ourselves he said we have a massive game next up and we are just looking forward to preparing for that scotland are improving all the time like us they did well in france and were unlucky not to get a win against ireland they played fantastically well in the first 15 minutes before falling away they are probably going on a similar journey to the one we have been on in the last couple of years
0,losing yourself in online gaming online role playing games are time consuming but enthralling flights from reality but are some people taking their fantasy lives too seriously when video game world of warcraft hit the shops in europe last week fans wrote in to the bbc website to express their delight and to offer a warning an addiction to a game like this is far more costly in time than any substance could impair keep track of time wrote travis anderson in texas some of the comments were humorous this game is so good i m not going to get it there s no way i could limit the hours i d spend playing it wrote charles macintyre from england but some struck a more worrying tone about the massively multiplayer online role playing game mmorpg you need to get out more could be the motto of any mmorpg shame they are getting more popular as you know this problem is just going to mushroom wrote stuart stanton davies in huddersfield scare mongering articles about addictive video games have existed since the days the first game of pong stopped everyone from working at the atari offices gaming is like any other pastime it can quickly become an unhealthy obsession whether it is spending too much time in the gym in front of the television or reading poetry unfortunately gaming and addiction is a far too easy association to make however stories about gamers spending 10 to 15 hours a day in front of some video games are becoming more frequent and the impact that is having on their families is quite distressing for some massively multiplayer online role playing games mmorpgs allow thousands of gamers to share a common experience of sharing fantasy or science fiction worlds the scope of these games like warcraft everquest ultima among others is epic and exploration and adventure is almost infinite part of the problem is grinding by which gamers have to perform long winded mindless tasks to bring up their levels and gain access to more adventure such open endedness brings with it a desire to keep playing not for no reason is everquest eq nicknamed evercrack e hayot writing in the culture blogzine print culture said recently i used to play the online role playing game everquest a lot by a lot i mean probably 15 to 20 hours a week on average and on weeks where i didn t have to work as many as 30 or 40 hours he says that in the world of online gaming such behaviour wasn t that unusual lots of people i knew in the game played eq that much you lie you don t go into work because you had stuff to do at home you cancel or refuse invitations to dinner you spend much less time watching tv a good thing presumably he wrote explaining how everquest took over his time he quit the game he says because he realised life was more fun than everquest let us be clear such obsession is rare but the huge growth in online gaming means a growth in the numbers of people who take their passion for a hobby too far almost 400 000 people bought a copy of world of warcraft in the first two days on sale earlier this month only a fraction will descend into obsessives the thoughts of families and friends of gamers who have been affected by everquest can be found on one blog everquest daily grind jane who runs the website compiles a chronicle of heart rending stories i am actually convinced at this point that there are more than some people who spend more times in mmoprgs than in reality she said one unnamed correspondent all are anonymous wrote on the rare nights when my husband does come to bed at the same time as i do i find that i am so used to sleeping by myself that it is difficult to get to sleep with another body laying next to me i can t talk to him while he is playing there is absolutely no point as he doesn t hear me or is so distracted that i get a ummm ya a few minutes after i ask him a question gaming widows has become a comedic term for women who have been shut out by male gamers but for some it is not in the least funny another correspondent wrote i believe that he is addicted to the online gaming and that is the cause of his depression and restlessness and some of them are even sadder today our son was five days old the sad truth is my husband spent 11 hours today playing his warcraft game he did not interact with our sweet tiny baby because there were important quests waiting online video game fans often complain that their hobby is misunderstood or marginalised but as gaming becomes ever more mainstream and games ever more immersive there will be no hiding place for social problems i wish 30 40 hours a week was unusual but i think it probably isn t an 11 hour stretch isn t that surprising i ve known people to play 15 hours at a stretch i know of people who are spending their week s holiday from work playing warcraft i know of people who would play ever crack in shifts waking at 3am to take over from their friends and resume waiting for an item they needed to appear i understand that the key sign of an addiction is if you alter your life around it rather than fit it into your life by all standards many of us are addicts so is the solution to force ourselves to stop playing or do we just need to make real life a bit more interesting sadly with all the talk of people becoming obsessed with gaming i find myself longing to have the time to join them i have been in a long term relationship for over 4 years since that began games have become more and more complex and more and more so i find i have less and less time to play them with and marriage and work being the main drag on my time i think the line between playing a game a lot and a gaming addiction is really quite distinct i play games a lot definately over 20 hours a week but i don t go missing work or other commitments in order to play games i have about a year ago deleted every game on my computer rpgs are the worst the real world fades and all your worries sorround a new magic staff or mighty sword unlike books or perhaps even tv you gain absolutely nothing when you stop playing you re at the same point as when you started all the achievements of your 10 hour session are irretrievably locked in the game and since you ve gained nothing in the real world you may as well pile on more achievement in the fake one despite having little monetary value the rewards and encouragement offered by these mmorpgs is enough to hook games for hours daily if only business could learn to leverage that very simply human need for easily measurable progress and recognition perhaps the unhealthily obsessed simply need more recognition for their achievements in reality my advice to gaming widows is if you can t beat em join em that is try playing it yourself if he wants to play as well well at least you ll be together somewhere i was an addict and it cost me my relationship i still play now but without the guilt hehe how long have i played in one sitting from morning till the early hours of the next day the birds were singing out side and i had to hobble to the bath room cos my bladder was so full i was in pain i would hardly eat perhaps some toast smoke endlessly and drink now thankfully the fascination has worn off and i have a girlfriend but still no job for the most part online gaming give me an adiction to illusory achievement and as there is no end in sight you keep going for the mirage of the ultimate obsessive behaviour is of course always cause for concern but it always bothers me when articles about gaming talk in terms of reality obviously somebody who spends thirty hours a week playing everquest has a problem this problem however has nothing to do with a dysfunctional sense of reality an obsessive eq player does not consider the game to be real any more than for example an obsessive automotive tinkerer considers their car to be human if mmorpgs have a unique danger in terms of encouraging obsessive behaviour it is not that they create an absorbing virtual world but rather that they can be easily accessed 24 7 the problem here does not lie with the nature of gaming but with the nature of modern 24 hour culture the problem with these so called mmorpgs is that you can never really complete them there s always another quest to do a few of my friends have only had about 10 hours sleep since it was released friday championship manager consumed my life for years one particular session started at about 2pm on a sunday paused for a brief sleep at 5am on the monday and after visit to university for classes restarted at about midday for another 10 hour session the people who tend to hark on about about the problems of hardcore gaming seem to be those who have rarely allowed themselves to become immersed in a game i would expect their perspective to change if they were to do that i used to be an everquest addict while i was in college it came to the point where the gaming world felt more real than the real one i failed alot of my courses and was able to barely graduate i was lucky that i came to my senses when i did others were less fortunate and dropped out of college now that i am holding a job i avoid online rpgs like the plague when i was made redundant i told my partner i had a new job for three months whilst every day i played everquest from 7 30am till 5 pm when she came home i pretended i had just got in as well hence justifying playing it all evening i have since quit playing mmorpg and have a good job when i got to the point where i was eating my dinner in front of the pc i realised things were getting silly so i m trying not to spend so much time on there it s not easy i feel as if i ve got a real addiction going on here for me the problem is that i love to complete a goal once it is completed that is it i am finished time to move on i become obsessed to complete the goal so from that standpoint it is an addiction in a game where you will never complete an ultimate goal well it would be like falling into a black pit it is easier to escape into a controlled fantasy world than face reality at times in other words the goal offered in the pc game are easier and more fun than the real world pretty scary implications if you think about it i can t buy world of warcraft as it would destroy my marrage i just know it i played star wars galaxies for about a year and can attest to the addictiveness of these games they are all engineered in such a way that early on in the game you progress quickly but this progress becomes exponentially slower requiring more and more time to reach the next level i m sad to say that at the peak of my addiction i was spending entire weekends in front of my monitor slowly building up my character stopping only for food and toilet breaks thankfully i made a clean break and actually managed to sell my jedi account for 800 which is my only sanity check in an otherwise completely unproductive time vacuum seven years ago i began playing ultima online this game dominated 2 years of my life they were 2 wonderful years and i still have vivid memories of the experiences and friends i had online gaming can be a world of escapism where you can be yourself without fear of the thoughts of others something that cannot always be achieved in the day to day running of a normal life whilst i would warn against people giving to much of there life to these games i believe they are a better way to spend your time than say watching tv gaming is addictive and should be made a recognised addiction when i was single i used to play upto eight hours a night after work every night for about a year building up my stats completing evermore quests and battling ogres but somehow i found time to get out even met someone and got married has my life changed hell no i still cast spells and battle till the early hours of the morning on with the fun online gaming should be enjoyed just as much as you would enjoy watching television or going to the cinema or the pub with your mates many people use recreational drugs on an occasional basis and are able to lead succesfull lives with families relationships and good careers a minority allow drugs to take over and destroy their lives and become addicted according to this article the same is true of mmorpgs the message to the government is clear either legalise drugs or outlaw online gaming sounds like there are some sad stories here and i can believe them all i play alot of warcraft myself and know full well how addictive it is i am resolute that it will not take over my life it certainly gets in the way though i think that some people simply do not know how to draw this line or lack the willpower to stop themselves stepping over it i think i m obsessed with gaming in general i spend far too much time playing games like everquest 2 and football manager rather than going out and interacting with real people and when i do try to i m always thinking in the back if my mind that i d rather be in front of the computer winning the league with cambridge united i am obsessed with online role playing games it s not so much quests but it has the adrenaline of a real life situation goals to achieve etc i spend about five hours per day online playing it and i rarely get more than four to five hours sleep before getting up for work the next morning as many of the players spend their time in mmorpgs rather than in front of the tv i fail to see how it will affect players social lives negatively furthermore these types of games contain a huge social aspect whereas other games and some other pursuits such as being a couch potato the players could be indulging in are solitary by nature these games are like most things too much of anything is a bad thing but as long as you can walk away from the computer to do other things too they can be great fun living in korea at the moment they have lots pc bangs internet cafes nearly most of south koreans are addicted to online games and one korean died because of the lack of food and water he had through playing online games i play xbox live every day i find my self lying and rescheduling everything around my gaming fix the longest i played was a 24 hour straight session i know i play for to long but it s an obsession that i can t control can you reccomend a counsellor this is not a wind up but something i m increasingly concerned with me and my mate play online for an hour or two a day we re both aware of how much time can disappear by sitting in front of a tv trying to frag some individual it s getting the balance between getting home and relasing the stress of a day by an hour or so gaming and enjoying real life i bought the us version of world of warcraft when it came out the longest period i played was 23 hrs straight i gave up the game after a month because it was so addictive but have subsequently just bought the european version couldn t help myself in future i m going to regulate my time far more strictly great game having played mmorpg games for some years i agree that these type of games can be life sucking but my concern is for the younger generation of gamers that play for hours on end in an adult enviroment most mmorpg games you need a credit card to play but i dont think parents know just what they are letting there children into unless there is undeniable medical proof that staring at a computer screens for hours at a time can damage a person 191 s health you can expect this not to decline but to get worse these people are pathetic they need to get off their machines and notice that our world is being swiftly overcome by issues and troubles that make the trifling worries of and online universe absolutely meaningless 24hours when i was a kid at school and i was on half term ultima online was the game ahhhh them was the days lol

0,ds aims to touch gamers the mobile gaming industry is set to explode in 2005 with a number of high profile devices offering a range of gaming and other features such as movie and music playback market leader nintendo however is releasing a handheld console that it says will revolutionise the way games are played the first striking thing about the ds is how retro it looks far from looking like a mould breaking handheld it looks more like nintendo dug out a mould from a 1980s handheld prototype the lightweight clam shell device opens up to reveal two screens and when switched on it instantly reveals its pedigree both screens are crisp and clear while the bottom of the two is touch sensitive nintendo has given developers free rein to utilise the dual screens and ability to control the action by simply touching the screen the japanese gaming giant hopes the ds will maintain the firm s pre eminence in an increasingly competitive mobile gaming market nintendo first launched its gameboy console in 1989 and has dominated the market ever since but its lead can no longer be taken for granted sony will enter the market later this year with its playstation portable while start up companies gizmondo and tapwave zodiac are also offering hybrid devices we believe the ds will appeal to all ages both genders and gamers of any skill said david yarnton nintendo europe s general manager said at the recent press launch for the handheld with its two screens wireless connectivity and backwards compatibility with the gameboy advance the ds certainly has a number of unique selling points it went on sale in the us in mid november priced 150 and nintendo says sales have exceeded expectations without giving detailed figures japan and europe will have to wait until the first quarter of 2005 to get the device with more than two million pre orders for the device in japan nintendo is confident it will keep its number one spot but will the device prove to be as revolutionary as claimed the game ships with a demo of metroid hunters a 3d action title which can be played alone or with a group of friends using the machine s wireless capabilities it certainly looks impressive on the small machine and plays smoothly even with a group of people the game can be controlled by using the supplied stylus to aim the top screen is used to navigate the action while the bottom screen offers a top down map and the ability to switch weapons it is certainly a unique control method and while it makes aiming more controlled it can be a little disorientating super mario 64 ds is a faithful re creation of the nintendo 64 classic with a host of new mini games and new levels the game looks stunning on the portable machine and the sound too is impressive for such a small machine one thing is for certain hardened gamers will have to learn to adapt to a new way of playing while it could prove to be an accessible way in to gaming for novices ultimately the success or failure of the device lies in the hands of developers if they manage to create titles which use the nintendo ds s key features then a whole new market of gamers could open up the fear is that the touch screen and voice recognition are treated as little more than gimmicks

4,debate needed on donations cap a cap on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet the elections watchdog has said fears that big donors can buy political favours have sparked calls for a limit in a new report the electoral commission says it is worth debating a 10 000 cap for the future but now is not the right time to introduce it it also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning there were almost 68m in reported donations to political parties in 2001 2002 and 2003 with nearly 12m of them from individual gifts worth more than 1m the rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties but the report says there are still public suspicions the commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work while we are not in principle opposed to the introduction of a donation cap we do not believe that such a major departure from the existing system now would be sensible says its report if there was to be a cap it should be 10 000 a small enough amount to make a difference but which would have banned 56m in donations between 2001 and 2003 even without changes the commission does urge political parties to seek out more small scale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under 200 it also suggests increasing state funding for parties to 3m so help can be extended to all parties with at least two members in the house of commons european parliament scottish parliament welsh assembly or northern ireland assembly and it suggests new ways of boosting election campaigning seen as a way of improving voter turnout all local election candidates should be entitled to a free mailshot for campaign leaflets says the watchdog and there should be a shift in the amount of money allowed to be spent at elections from a national level to a local level to help politicians engage better with voters the report suggests doubling the money which can be spent by candidates while cutting national spending limits from 20m to 15m the commission also says the spending limits for general elections should cover the four months before the poll as happens with other elections electoral commission chairman sam younger said there is no doubt that political parties have a vital role to play in maintaining the health of our democracy and for this they need to be adequately resourced our research has shown that people want to be more informed about party politics and that they want politicians to be more visible and accessible the public are reluctant for the state to fund parties but at the same time are unhappy with large private donations he called for a wider public debate on party funding to find the consensus needed for radical changes to the current system

0,intel unveils laser breakthrough intel has unveiled research that could mean data is soon being moved around chips at the speed of light scientists at intel have overcome a fundamental problem that before now has prevented silicon being used to generate and amplify laser light the breakthrough should make it easier to interconnect data networks with the chips that process the information the intel researchers said products exploiting the breakthrough should appear by the end of the decade we ve overcome a fundamental limit said dr mario paniccia director of intel s photonics technology lab writing in the journal nature dr paniccia and colleagues haisheng rong richard jones ansheng liu oded cohen dani hak and alexander fang show how they have made a continuous laser from the same material used to make computer processors currently says dr paniccia telecommunications equipment that amplifies the laser light that travels down fibre optic cables is very expensive because of the exotic materials such as gallium arsenide used to make it telecommunications firms and chip makers would prefer to use silicon for these light moving elements because it is cheap and many of the problems of using it in high volume manufacturing have been solved we re trying to take our silicon competency in manufacturing and apply it to new areas said dr paniccia while work has been done to make some of the components that can move light around before now silicon has not successfully been used to generate or amplify the laser light pulses used to send data over long distances this is despite the fact that silicon is a much better amplifier of light pulses than the form of the material used in fibre optic cables this improved amplification is due to the crystalline structure of the silicon used to make computer chips dr paniccia said that the structure of silicon meant that when laser light passed through it some colliding photons rip electrons off the atoms within the material it creates a cloud of electrons sitting in the silicon and that absorbs all the light he said but the intel researchers have found a way to suck away these errant electrons and turn silicon into a material that can both generate and amplify laser light even better the laser light produced in this way can with the help of easy to make filters be tuned across a very wide range of frequencies semi conductor lasers made before now have only produced light in a narrow frequency ranges the result could be the close integration of the fibre optic cables that carry data as light with the computer chips that process it dr paniccia said the work was the one of several steps needed if silicon was to be used to make components that could carry and process light in the form of data pulses it s a technical validation that it can work he said

0,why cell will get the hard sell the world is casting its gaze on the cell processor for the first time but what is so important about it and why is it so different the backers of the processor are big names in the computer industry ibm is one of the largest and most respected chip makers in the world providing cutting edge technology to large businesses sony will be using the chip inside its playstation 3 console and its dominance of the games market means that it now has a lot of power to dictate the future of computer and gaming platforms the technology inside the cell is being heralded as revolutionary from a technical standpoint traditional computers whether they are household pcs or playstation 2s use a single processor to carry out the calculations that run the computer the cell technology on the other hand uses multiple cell processors linked together to run lots of calculations simultaneously this gives it processing power an order of magnitude above its competitors whilst its rivals are working on similar technology it is sony s which is the most advanced the speed of computer memory has been slowly increasing over the last few years but the memory technology that accompanies the cell is a huge leap in performance using a technology called xdr created by american firm rambus memory can run up to eight times faster than the current standard being promoted by intel perhaps more important than any of the technology is the cell s role in the imminent war on living rooms the big trend predicted for this year is the convergence of computers with home entertainment devices such as dvd players and hi fis companies like microsoft and sony believe that there is a lot of money to be made by putting a computer underneath the tv of every household and then offering services such as music and video downloads as well as giving an individual access to all the media they already own in one place microsoft has already made its first tactical move into this area with its windows media center software which has been adopted by many pc makers sony had a stab at something similar with the psx a variation on the playstation last year in japan although this attempt was generally seen as a failure both companies believe that increasing the capabilities of games consoles to make them as powerful as pcs will make the technology accessible enough to persuade buyers to give them pride of place on the video rack sony and ibm want to make sure that the dominance of the pc market enjoyed by microsoft and intel is not allowed to extend to this market by creating a radically new architecture and using that architecture in a games console that is sure to be a huge seller they hope that the cell processor can become the dominant technology in the living room shutting out their rivals once they have established themselves under the tv there is no doubt that they hope to use this as a base camp to extend their might into our traditional pcs and instigate a regime change on the desktop cell is in fact specifically designed to be deployed throughout the house the links between the multiple processors can also be extended to reach cell processors in entirely different systems sony hopes to put cells in televisions kitchen appliances and anywhere that could use any sort of computer chip each cell will be linked to the others creating a vast home network of computing power resources of the cells across the house can be pooled to provide more power and the links can also be used to enable devices to talk to each other so that you can programme your microwave from your tv for example this digital home of the future depends on the widespread adoption of the cell processor and there are as with all things a number of reasons it could fail because the processor is so different it requires programmers to learn a different way of writing software and it may be that the changeover is simply too difficult for them to master you can also guarantee that microsoft and intel are not going to sit around and let cell take over home computing without a fight microsoft is going to be pushing its xbox 2 as hard as possible to make sure that its technology not sony s will be under your tree next christmas intel will be furiously working on new designs that address the problems of its current chips to create a rival technology to cell so that it doesn t lose its desktop pc dominance if cell succeeds in becoming the living room technology of choice however it could provide the jump start to the fully digital home of the future the revolution might not be televised but it could well be played with a videogame controller
0,football manager scores big time for the past decade or so the virtual football fans among us will have become used to the annual helping of championship manager cm indeed it seems like there has been a cm game for as many years as there have been pcs however last year was the final time that developers sports interactive si and publishers eidos would work together they decided to go their separate ways and each kept a piece of the franchise si kept the game s code and database and eidos retained rights to the cm brand and the look and feel of the game so at the beginning of this year fans faced a new situation eidos announced the next cm game with a new team to develop it from scratch whilst si developed the existing code further to be released with new publishers sega under the name football manager so what does this mean well football manager is the spiritual successor to the cm series and it has been released earlier than expected at this point cm5 looks like it will ship early next year but given that football manager 2005 is by and large the game that everybody knows and loves how does this new version shape up a game like fm2005 could blind you with statistics it has an obscene number of playable leagues an obscene number of manageable teams and a really obscene number of players and staff from around the world in the database with stats faithfully researched and compiled by a loyal army of fans but that does not do justice to the game really what we are talking about is the most realistic and satisfying football management game to ever grace the earth you begin by picking the nations and leagues you want to manage teams from for instance england and scotland that will give you a choice not just of the four main scottish leagues but the english premiership all the way down to the conference north and south of course you might be looking for european glory or to get hold of abramovich s millions in which case you can take control at chelsea or even barcelona real madrid ac milan the list goes on a very long way once in a team you will be told by the board what they expect of you sometimes it is promotion or a place in europe sometimes it is consolidation or a brave relegation battle it might even be a case of champions or else obviously the expectations are linked to the team you choose so choose wisely then it is time to look at your squad work out your tactics seeing how much cash if any you have got to splash having a look at the transfer market sorting out the training schedule and making sure your backroom staff are up to it then bring on the matches which are once more available in the ever improving top down 2d view with the exception of the improved user interface on the surface not much else seems to have changed however there have been a lot of changes under the bonnet as well things like the manager mind games which let you talk to the media about the opposition bosses the match engine is also much improved and it is more of a joy than ever to watch in fact just about every area of the game has been tweaked and it leads to an ever more immersive experience with a game that is so complex and so open ended there are of course a few glitches but nowhere near the sorts of problems that have blighted previous releases with so many calculations to perform the game can take some time to process in between matches though there have been improvements in this area and a sport like football which is so high profile and unpredictable itself can never be modelled quite to everybody s satisfaction but this time around a great deal of hard work has been put in to ensure that any oddities that do crop up are cosmetic only and do not affect gameplay and if there are problems further down the line sports interactive have indicated their usual willingness to support and develop the game as far as possible in all there are many more tweaks and improvements if you were a fan of the previous cm games then fm2005 might make you forget there was anything else before it if you are new to the genre but like the idea of trying to take margate into the premiership spurs into europe or even putting rangers back on the top of the tree fm2005 could be the best purchase you ever made just be warned that the family might not see you much at christmas football manager 2005 out now for the pc and the mac

4,kennedy s cautious optimism charles kennedy is far too canny to make any grand claims about how his party may fare at the general election in his 22 years in the commons he has seen his fair share of such claims dashed on the rocks of bitter experience and he might say the uk s political and electoral system but even his caution cannot hide the fact that this is a party and a leader that believes it may well be on the way to something special in a few months time look i have already said i am not going to put any artificial limits on our ambitions this time around he said he still seems to accept that the most likely outcome is another labour victory of some sort and his general election pitch is designed around the notion of the lib dems as the real opposition but doesn t that lead to the jibe that his is a party actively bidding to come second he is prepared to go this far a clear conclusion has been reached including by conservatives that the conservatives are not going to win this election therefore the potential is there for the liberal democrat advance to be one of the big stories of the election given that we have the capacity to take on labour and win as well as take on the conservatives and win this is really going to be the first modern three party uk election that we have all experienced but haven t we been here before with suggestions in the 1980s that labour was finished won t voters looking for an alternative to labour still naturally gravitate to the conservatives the problem is that geographically the conservative party has melted away in about a third of britain we have supplanted them as the main alternative to labour in whole tracts of mainland britain and they are a party with an ageing and declining membership base and they just do not look vibrant or vital or in touch any longer with contemporary britain mr kennedy is also eager to dispel any impression his party is the new party of the left and is likely to attract mostly disillusioned labour voters he insists his three headline commitments to be financed from a 1 tax increase on those earning over 100 000 a year will appeal right across the political spectrum they are to replace the council tax with a local income tax provide free long term care for the elderly and scrap student fees he also believes being the only major party promising to increases taxes will not land him in the same trouble a similar policy did to old labour i think the tax argument has moved on a lot in british politics particularly in the context of the forthcoming general election he said under a labour government the tax burden would have to rise while the tories plans to increase spending in some areas while also reducing taxes is just incredible he claims we are being straightforward with people saying you know there is likely to be an increase in the tax burden we are only recommending one specific tax rise for the top end of income scale earners to fund three specific policies that is a clear cut choice for people one i am very comfortable with and i think will distinguish us from the others as to his own future he is clear if as expected his party increases its showing at the election he intends to go into the next parliament on the front foot with a view to leading it right through that parliament into the next election because i see that as the decisive opportunity for us that last remark reflects a view gaining ground in westminster that if the tories do as badly as some fear the election after next might really see that historic breakthrough by the third party perhaps then mr kennedy will be ready to put some of the caution to one side
2,celts savour grand slam prospect the six nations has heralded a new order in northern hemisphere rugby this year and wales and ireland rather than traditional big guns france and england face a potential grand slam play off in three weeks time but before that game in cardiff wales must get past scotland at murrayfield while ireland face the not insignificant task of a home fixture with the mercurial french no one knows what mood france will be in at lansdowne road on 12 march sublime as in the first half against wales or ridiculous like in the same period against england at twickenham but how the mighty have fallen england sat on rugby s summit 15 months ago as world champions and 2003 grand slam winners but they have lost nine of their 14 matches since that heady night in sydney and they face the ignominy of what could amount to a wooden spoon play off against italy in a fortnight england are enduring their worst run in the championship since captain richard hill was dumped in favour of mike harrison after three straight losses in 1987 coach andy robinson who took over from the successful sir clive woodward in september has lost a phalanx of world cup stars and he is enduring the toughest of teething problems in bedding down his own style with a new team the same year that england ruled the roost a woeful wales lost all five matches in the six nations and they won only two games against scotland and italy in 2004 wales most recent championship title was in 1994 and their last grand slam success came in 1978 in the era of gareth edwards phil bennett jpr williams et al but welsh rugby fans remain on permanent tenterhooks for the blossoming of a new golden age after several false dawns coach mike ruddock may have come up with the team and philosophy to match expectations the fresh verve is inspired by skipper gareth thomas now out with a broken thumb accurate kicking from either fly half stephen jones or centre gavin henson a rampant martyn williams leading the way up front and exciting runners in the guise of henson and shane williams ireland coach eddie o sullivan and captain brian o driscoll have got their side buzzing too and they are close to shedding the nearly men tag that has dogged them for the past few years the men from the emerald isle have been six nations runners up for the past two years to france and england but they have not won the title since 1985 and last clinched a grand slam in 1948 as for scotland they have struggled this decade and the 2004 wooden spoon winners have not been in the top two since they lifted the title in 1999 italy continue the elusive search for their first six nations away win and can still only account for the scalps of scotland twice and wales since joining the elite in 2000 coach john kirwan is a passionate and dedicated believer in the azzurri but is lacking in raw materials and so to france brilliant one minute inept the next but the reigning champions could quite easily turn on the style in dublin and end up winning the title through the back door ireland though have won three times in their last five meetings welsh romantics would probably prefer a glorious victory in the celtic showdown to crown their grand slam but given that ireland have beaten wales in four of their last five meetings the welsh legions are likely to be behind les bleus on 12 march

4,debate needed on donations cap a cap on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet the elections watchdog has said fears that big donors can buy political favours have sparked calls for a limit in a new report the electoral commission says it is worth debating a 10 000 cap for the future but now is not the right time to introduce it it also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning there were almost 68m in reported donations to political parties in 2001 2002 and 2003 with nearly 12m of them from individual gifts worth more than 1m the rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties but the report says there are still public suspicions the commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work while we are not in principle opposed to the introduction of a donation cap we do not believe that such a major departure from the existing system now would be sensible says its report if there was to be a cap it should be 10 000 a small enough amount to make a difference but which would have banned 56m in donations between 2001 and 2003 even without changes the commission does urge political parties to seek out more small scale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under 200 it also suggests increasing state funding for parties to 3m so help can be extended to all parties with at least two members in the house of commons european parliament scottish parliament welsh assembly or northern ireland assembly and it suggests new ways of boosting election campaigning seen as a way of improving voter turnout all local election candidates should be entitled to a free mailshot for campaign leaflets says the watchdog and there should be a shift in the amount of money allowed to be spent at elections from a national level to a local level to help politicians engage better with voters the report suggests doubling the money which can be spent by candidates while cutting national spending limits from 20m to 15m the commission also says the spending limits for general elections should cover the four months before the poll as happens with other elections electoral commission chairman sam younger said there is no doubt that political parties have a vital role to play in maintaining the health of our democracy and for this they need to be adequately resourced our research has shown that people want to be more informed about party politics and that they want politicians to be more visible and accessible the public are reluctant for the state to fund parties but at the same time are unhappy with large private donations he called for a wider public debate on party funding to find the consensus needed for radical changes to the current system
1,no seasonal lift for house market a swathe of figures have provided further evidence of a slowdown in the uk property market the council of mortgage lenders cml british bankers association bba and building societies association bsa all said mortgage lending was slowing cml figures showed gross lending fell by 4 in november as the number of people buying new homes fell elsewhere the bba added underlying mortgage lending rose by 4m in november compared to october s 4 29m the cml said that loans for new property purchases fell 25 year on year to 85 000 the lowest total seen since february 2003 data from the cml showed lending fell to just over 25bn in november from 25 5bn a year earlier separate figures from the building societies association showed the value of mortgage approvals loans agreed but not yet made stood 32 lower than at the same time last year at a seasonally adjusted 2 98bn the figures come hot on the heels of new data from property website rightmove which suggested owners must indulge in a winter sale and slash prices by up to 8 miles shipside commercial director at rightmove said sellers would have to be more realistic with their asking prices to tempt buyers the average asking price of a home fell by more than 600 from 190 329 in november to 189 733 in december while the length of time it takes to sell a home rose to 81 days from 53 in the summer rightmove said estate agents were set to enter 2005 with a third more properties on their books than a year ago even once the quieter holiday period is over sellers will find themselves competing with a lot of other properties on the market in any business excess supply and low demand means one thing cut prices mr shipside said the proof is that some properties that have been appropriately discounted are selling even in the current market overall asking prices have fallen 3 3 from their july peaks as the equivalent of 6 500 has been cut from an average property a host of mortgage lenders and economists have predicted that property prices will either fall or stagnate in 2005 what is apparent is a picture of a slowing market but one that should remain stable as we return to more normal volumes of lending over 2005 as a whole cml director general michael coogan said it s a fairly consistent picture showing that mortgage demand has fallen back again which is consistent with a continuing correction in the housing market investec economist philip shaw said however the figures do suggest only a modest weakening and we stand by our view that the property market will remain in the doldrums for some time though a collapse is still unlikely

0,when invention turns to innovation it is unlikely that future technological inventions are going to have the same kind of transformative impact that they did in the past when history takes a look back at great inventions like the car and transistor they were defining technologies which ultimately changed people s lives substantially but says nick donofrio senior vice president of technology and manufacturing at ibm it was not the thing itself that actually improved people s lives it was all the social and cultural changes that the discovery or invention brought with it the car brought about a crucial change to how people lived in cities giving them the ability to move out into the suburbs whilst having mobility and access when we talk about innovation and creating real value in the 21st century we have to think more like this but faster mr donofrio told the bbc news website after giving the royal academy of engineering 2004 hinton lecture the invention discovery is likely not to have the same value as the transistor had or the automobile had the equivalent of those things will be invented or discovered but by themselves they are just not going to able to generate real business value or wealth as these things did these are not altogether new ideas and academics have been exploring how technologies impact wider society for years but what it means for technology companies is that a new idea method or device will have to have a different kind thinking behind it so that people see the value that innovative technology has for them we are in a different phase now when it comes to technology argues mr donofrio industry week s 2003 technology leader of the year the hype and over promise is over and now technology leaders have to demonstrate that things work make sense make a difference and life gets better as a result in the dotcom era there was something that was jumping up in your face every five minutes somebody had a new thing that would awe you you weren t quite sure that it did anything you weren t quite sure if you needed it you weren t quite sure if it had value for it but it was cool but change and innovation in technology that people will see affecting their daily lives he says will come about slowly subtlety and in ways that will no longer be in your face it will creep in pervasively nanotechnologies will play a key part in this kind of pervasive environment in all sorts of ways through new superconducting materials to coatings power and memory storage i am a very big believer in the evolution of this industry into a pervasive environment in an incredible network infrastructure says mr donofrio pervasive computing is where wireless computing rules and where jewellery clothes and everyday objects become the interfaces instead of bulky wires screens and keyboards the net becomes a true network that is taken for granted and just there like air people will not have to do anything to stay connected people will know their lives are just better says mr donofrio trillions of devices will be connected to the net in ways people will not know natural interfaces will develop devices will shape your persona and our technologically underused voices could be telling our jewellery to sort out the finances ultimately there will be says mr donofrio no value in being computer illiterate to some it sounds like a technological world gone mad to mr donofrio it is a vision innovation that will happen behind this vision should be a rich robust network capability and deep computing says mr donofrio deep computing is the ability to perform lots of complex calculations on massive amounts of data and integral to this concept is supercomputing it has value according to ibm because it helps humans work out extremely complex problems to come up with valuable solutions like how to refine millions of net search results finding cures for diseases or understanding of exactly how a gene or protein operates but pervasive computing presumably means having technologies that are aware of diversity of contexts commands and requirements of a diverse world as computing and technologies become part of the environment part of furniture walls and clothing physical space becomes a more important consideration this is going to need a much broader range of skills and experience i am confident that the set science engineering and technology industry is going to be short on skills he says if i am right about what innovation is you need to be multidisciplinary and collaborative women tend to have those traits a lot better than men eventually women could win out in both life and physical sciences he says in the uk a dti funded resource centre for women has set a target to have 40 representation on set industry boards ibm according to mr donofrio has 30 our goal is for our research team to become the preferred organisation for women in science and technology to begin their career the whole issue of global diversity is as much a business matter as it is a moral and social concern to mr donofrio we believe in the whole issue of global diversity he says our customers are diverse our clients are diverse they expect us to look like them as more and more women or underrepresented minorities succeed into leadership positions it becomes and imperative for us to constantly look like them

0,mobile games come of age the bbc news website takes a look at how games on mobile phones are maturing a brief round up follows but you can skip straight to the reviews by clicking on the links below if you think of snake when some mentions mobile games then you could be in for a bit of a surprise this is because mobile games have come a long way in a very short time even before nokia s n gage game phone launched in late 2003 many mobile operators were realising that there was an audience looking for something to play on their handset and given that many more people own handsets than own portable game playing gadgets such as the gameboy it could be a very lucrative market that audience includes commuters wanting something to fill their time on the way home game fans looking for a bit of variety and hard core gamers who like to play every moment they can life for all these types of player has got immeasurably better in the last year as the numbers of titles you can download to your phone has snowballed now sites such as wireless gaming review list more than 200 different titles for some uk networks and the ranges suit every possible taste there are ports of pc and arcade classics such as space invaders lunar lander and bejewelled there are also versions of titles such as colin mcrae rally that you typically find on pcs and consoles there are shoot em ups adventure games strategy titles and many novel games only found on handsets rarely now does an action movie launch without a mobile game tie in increasingly such launches are all part of the promotional campaign for a film understandable when you realise that a good game can rack up millions of downloads the returns can be pretty good when you consider that some games cost 5 what has also helped games on mobiles thrive is the fact that it is easier than ever to get hold of them thanks to technology known as wap push by sending a text message to a game maker you can have the title downloaded to your handset far better than having to navigate through the menus of most mobile operator portals the number of handsets that can play games has grown hugely too almost half of all phones now have java onboard meaning that they can play the increasingly sophisticated games that are available even the ones that use 3d graphics the minimum technology specifications that phones should adhere to are getting more sophisticated which means that games are too now double key presses are possible making familiar tactics such as moving and strafing a real option the processing power on handsets means that physics on mobile games is getting more convincing and the graphics are improving too some game makers are also starting to take advantage of the extra capabilities in a mobile many titles particularly racing games let you upload your best time to see how you compare to others usually you can get hold of their best time and race against a ghost or shadow to see if you can beat them a few games also let you take on people in real time via the network or if you are sitting close to them via bluetooth short range radio technology with so much going on it is hard to do justice to the sheer diversity of what is happening but these two features should help point you in the direction of the game makers and give you an idea of where to look and how to get playing too fast too furious digital bridges as soon as i start playing this i remember why i never play driving games because i m rubbish at them no matter if i drive the car via joystick or keypad i just cannot get the hang of braking for corners or timing a rush to pass other drivers the game rewards replay because to advance you have to complete every section within a time limit winning gives you cash for upgrades graphically the rolling road is a convincing enough evocation of speed as the palm trees and cactus whip by and the city scrolls past in the background the cars handle pretty well despite my uselessness but it was not clear if the different models of cars were appreciably different on the track the only niggle was that the interface was a bit confusing especially when using a joystick rather than the keypad to play fatal force macrospace a futuristic shooter that lets you either play various deathmatch modes against your phone or run through a series of scenarios that involves killing aliens invading earth graphics are a bit cartoon like but only helps to make clear what is going on and levels are well laid out and encourage you to leap about exploring both background music and sounds effects work well the scenarios are well scripted and you regularly get hints from the fatal force commanders weapons include flamethrowers rocket launchers grenades and at a couple of points you even get chance to use a mech for a short while with the right power up you can go into a matrix style bullet time to cope with the onslaught of aliens the game lets you play via bluetooth if others are in range online the game has quite a following with clans player rankings and even new downloadable maps
0,podcasters look to net money nasa is doing it 14 year old boys in bedrooms are doing it couples are doing it gadget lovers male and female are definitely doing it it is podcasting diy radio in the form of downloadable mp3 audio files they can done by anyone who has a microphone simple software the net and something to say some liken them to talking audioblogs because many complement text based weblogs diary like sites where people share their thoughts they are essentially amateur radio shows on the net on demand and the movement is at very early stages it s about real people saying real things and communicating says adam curry former mtv vj and the pied piper of podcasting he was one of a community of people who created ipodder a small computer program known as an aggregator it collects and automatically sends mp3 files to any digital music playing device that can play wmp formats those with digital music players can select which podcasts they like and subscribe for free to that show s feed when a new podcast is available it is automatically sent to the device when connected to a computer it is totally going to kill the business model of radio thinks curry i just did a tour of madison avenue where all the big brands and advertising agencies of the world are he says and they are scared to death of the next generation like my daughter who is 14 who don t listen to radio they are on msn they ve got their ipod their mp3 player they ve got their xbox they are not listening to radio so how are they going to reach these audiences it is the distribution that is changing and the barriers are being brought down so everyone can be part of it it is a fledgling movement but it is gaining momentum now that people have started thinking about how to make a business from it ian fogg jupiter research analyst thinks there could be potential for business but it could take an interesting turn if big companies like apple and microsoft get involved it is a nascent area but quite exciting it is yet another area that demonstrates the move to a digital lifestyle and digital home is not over he says podcasting is one of those interesting areas that bridges what you do at home and what you do out and about a classic hybrid it is another aspect of the time shifting of content the latest industry buzzword for being able to listen to what you want when and wherever you want audiences are in the 10s 100s and 1 000s rather than millions more than 4 300 podcasts are currently listed curry s daily source code which he committed to doing daily to inspire the community has 10s of thousands of listeners but dave winer is doubtful he designed the format called rss really simple syndication which gives web users an easy way to keep updated automatically on sites they like podcasts rely on his technology because it is the way they are distributed he is also writer of the longest running weblog on the net scripting news he thinks its power lies in its democratising potential not in its over hyped business promise we re the sources the people doing stuff and podcasting is a way to tell people who care what we re doing no matter how you look at it commercialising this medium isn t going to make very much money he says podcasting is going to be a medium of niches with audiences measured in the single digits like e mail or blogs maybe in a few years maybe six or seven digits but it will have to sustain interest beyond the hype balloon curry and associate ron bloom s new venture called podshow is to help ordinary people produce post distribute and market their podcasts because of the way podcasts work based on rss the latest podcasts which people can select mean that they are ready made targets when you look at podcasting wow this is a pretty interesting audience the audience is pre selected they have decided to subscribe to your program explains curry advertising in his eyes can be tailored to podcasts to make it more imaginative and unobtrusive how i believe this will work is to create a network that in aggregation will have enough numbers to support a return on investment for the advertisers and for the podcasters i have 50 60 70 000 listeners i could make a couple of bucks off that but not much if you are talking a million podcasters and then you can kind of divide that amongst ourselves then that is kind of interesting essentially he says if you are doing a bass fishing podcast someone who is selling bait and tackle will probably want to advertise on your show he is clear the ads will not be the traditional in your face type familiar to commercial radio now we are really going to see these microcosms and commerce will be all over the place it is happening already coffee loving curry has sold 4 000 worth of coffee machines through a referral link to amazon from his site others use in show promotions like the dawn and drew show one eric rice has won sponsorship from warner bros he can now legally play the music of a band warner bros wants to push some commentators on the net say it has a similar feel to the dotcom days others say it is just another element of setting media free from big companies and letting people be creative one thing is for sure they are not about to disappear in a hurry the creative forces behind radio are elated says curry for now he tunes out the negative comments within the podcasting

0,screensaver tackles spam websites net users are getting the chance to fight back against spam websites internet portal lycos has made a screensaver that endlessly requests data from sites that sell the goods and services mentioned in spam e mail lycos hopes it will make the monthly bandwidth bills of spammers soar by keeping their servers running flat out the net firm estimates that if enough people sign up and download the tool spammers could end up paying to send out terabytes of data we ve never really solved the big problem of spam which is that its so damn cheap and easy to do said malte pollmann spokesman for lycos europe in the past we have built up the spam filtering systems for our users he said but now we are going to go one step further we ve found a way to make it much higher cost for spammers by putting a load on their servers by getting thousands of people to download and use the screensaver lycos hopes to get spamming websites constantly running at almost full capacity mr pollmann said there was no intention to stop the spam websites working by subjecting them with too much data to cope with he said the screensaver had been carefully written to ensure that the amount of traffic it generated from each user did not overload the web every single user will contribute three to four megabytes per day he said about one mp3 file but he said if enough people sign up spamming websites could be force to pay for gigabytes of traffic every single day lycos did not want to use e mail to fight back said mr pollmann that would be fighting one bad thing with another bad thing he said the sites being targeted are those mentioned in spam e mail messages and which sell the goods and services on offer typically these sites are different to those that used to send out spam e mail and they typically only get a few thousand visitors per day the list of sites that the screensaver will target is taken from real time blacklists generated by organisations such as spamcop to limit the chance of mistakes being made lycos is using people to ensure that the sites are selling spam goods as these sites rarely use advertising to offset hosting costs the burden of high bandwidth bills could make spam too expensive said mr pollmann sites will also slow down under the weight of data requests early results show that response times of some sites have deteriorated by up to 85 users do not have to be registered users of lycos to download and use the screensaver while working the screensaver shows the websites that are being bothered with requests for data the screensaver is due to be launched across europe on 1 december and before now has only been trialled in sweden despite the soft launch mr pollmann said that the screensaver had been downloaded more than 20 000 times in the last four days there s a huge user demand to not only filter spam day by day but to do something more he said before now users have never had the chance to be a bit more offensive

4,tv debate urged for party chiefs broadcasters should fix a date for a pre election televised debate between the three main political leaders according to the hansard society it would then be up to tony blair michael howard and charles kennedy to decide whether to take part the non partisan charity said chairman lord holme argued that prime ministers should not have the right of veto on a matter of public interest the broadcasters should make the decision to go ahead he said lord holme s proposal for a televised debate comes just four months after millions of viewers were able to watch us president george w bush slug it out verbally with his democratic challenger john kerry he said it was a democratically dubious proposition that it was up to the incumbent prime minister to decide whether a similar event takes place here if mr blair did not want to take part the broadcasters could go ahead with an empty chair or cancel the event and explain their reasons why lord holme said what makes the present situation even less acceptable is that although mr howard and mr kennedy have said they would welcome a debate no one has heard directly from the prime minister he said it has been left to nudges and winks hints and briefings from his aides and campaign managers to imply that mr blair doesn t want one but we haven t heard from the prime minister himself lord holme who has campaigned for televised debates at previous elections said broadcasters were more than willing to cooperate with the arrangements opinion polls suggested that the idea had the backing of the public who like comparing the personalities and policies of the contenders in their own homes he said lord holme argued that as part of their public service obligations broadcasters should make the decision to go ahead as soon as the election is called an independent third party body such as the hansard society or electoral commission could work out the ground rules so they were fair to participants and informative to the public he said it would be up to each party leader to accept or refuse said lord holme if the prime minister s reported position is true and he does want to take part he would then be obliged to say why publicly the broadcasters would then have the option of cancelling the event for obvious and well understood reasons or going ahead with an empty chair either way would be preferable to the present hidden veto the hansard society has long campaigned for televised debates and has published reports on the issue in 1997 and 2001 tony blair has already ruled out taking part in a televised debate during the forthcoming election campaign last month he said we answer this every election campaign and for the reasons i have given before the answer is no he said at his monthly news conference

3,how the academy awards flourished the 77th annual academy awards are taking place on 27 february with the stars of the movie making world once again holding their breath to discover who will be showered with the honours this year but from humble beginnings how did the modern day extravaganza become the behemoth it is today how it all started the first academy awards were handed out in 1929 at a comparatively low key dinner held at the hollywood roosevelt hotel just over the road from their modern day home just 250 guests attended with ticket prices at 5 the first film to win was wings which starred clara bow in the only silent movie to win the big award for the first 10 years or so the winners list was handed to the newspapers so they could publish them at 11pm but in 1940 the winners were published in the los angeles times at 8 45pm meaning guests entering the ceremony knew already knew the results as a result the sealed envelope system was introduced leading to the secrecy and suspense filled night that happens today when and where the tradition of holding the awards at a banquet continued until 1942 but with increasing interest came a growing guest list and it became impractical to host it as a dinner the ceremonies were then transferred to theatres with the famous grauman s chinese theatre the first to host the expanded event other venues included the dorothy chandler pavilion and the shrine auditorium they are now held at the kodak theatre which opened in 2002 just across the road from its original home and holds 6 000 people until 1954 they were held on a thursday then swapped around from monday to wednesday before sunday night was settled on although the month swapped from may to april to march and now its current month of february the first televised ceremony was in 1953 with bob hope as the mc who was oscar there is no solid evidence as to how the trophy became to be known as oscar one popular story is that academy librarian margaret herrick said the statue looked like her uncle oscar a journalist apparently overheard this conversation and used the phrase in an article the first time it is thought to have been used in print was when columnist sidney skolsky used it to describe katherine hepburn s first best actress win in 1934 the academy officially adopted the nickname in 1939 the trophy was designed by mgm art director cedric gibbons since its inception 2 530 oscars have been handed out in support of the war effort the academy handed out plaster oscar statuettes during wwii after the war winners exchanged the plaster awards for the real thing fifty five statues were stolen in en route to the awards in 2000 52 were recovered nine days later winners were unaffected as a new batch was rushed out who sits in judgement the academy was set up in 1927 as a non profit organisation with 36 members from different film disciplines douglas fairbanks sr was the first president and oversaw the first awards there are now 5 700 members of the academy with membership by invitation only to those who are seen to have achieved distinction in the movies and are therefore seen as fit to judge their peers some of the criteria for admittance includes film credits that reflect the high standards of the academy receipt of an academy award nomination achievement of unique distinction earning of special merit or making an outstanding contribution to film the stars who left empty handed while many of the biggest films and movie makers have been honoured by the academy there is still surprise at those that did not receive any nominations that later went on to become classics among the overlooked films were hobson s choice dirty harry the 39 steps the searchers and king kong actors that failed to win for their iconic roles included al jolson in the jazz singer 1927 humphrey bogart in casablanca 1944 gene kelly in singing in the rain 1952 and henry fonda in 12 angry men 1957 alfred hitchcock also failed to win an award despite five nominations his enduring influence on the horror genre was finally recognised with an honorary gong in 1968 the show always goes on not even war has halted the glittering hollywood event there were calls for it to be cancelled in 2003 during the war in iraq but as it didn t stop during world war ii or the vietnam war documentary winner michael moore ensured nobody

0,ink helps drive democracy in asia the kyrgyz republic a small mountainous state of the former soviet republic is using invisible ink and ultraviolet readers in the country s elections as part of a drive to prevent multiple voting this new technology is causing both worries and guarded optimism among different sectors of the population in an effort to live up to its reputation in the 1990s as an island of democracy the kyrgyz president askar akaev pushed through the law requiring the use of ink during the upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections the us government agreed to fund all expenses associated with this decision the kyrgyz republic is seen by many experts as backsliding from the high point it reached in the mid 1990s with a hastily pushed through referendum in 2003 reducing the legislative branch to one chamber with 75 deputies the use of ink is only one part of a general effort to show commitment towards more open elections the german embassy the soros foundation and the kyrgyz government have all contributed to purchase transparent ballot boxes the actual technology behind the ink is not that complicated the ink is sprayed on a person s left thumb it dries and is not visible under normal light however the presence of ultraviolet light of the kind used to verify money causes the ink to glow with a neon yellow light at the entrance to each polling station one election official will scan voter s fingers with uv lamp before allowing them to enter and every voter will have his her left thumb sprayed with ink before receiving the ballot if the ink shows under the uv light the voter will not be allowed to enter the polling station likewise any voter who refuses to be inked will not receive the ballot these elections are assuming even greater significance because of two large factors the upcoming parliamentary elections are a prelude to a potentially regime changing presidential election in the autumn as well as the echo of recent elections in other former soviet republics notably ukraine and georgia the use of ink has been controversial especially among groups perceived to be pro government widely circulated articles compared the use of ink to the rural practice of marking sheep a still common metaphor in this primarily agricultural society the author of one such article began a petition drive against the use of the ink the greatest part of the opposition to ink has often been sheer ignorance local newspapers have carried stories that the ink is harmful radioactive or even that the ultraviolet readers may cause health problems others such as the aggressively middle of the road coalition of non governmental organizations have lauded the move as an important step forward this type of ink has been used in many elections in the world in countries as varied as serbia south africa indonesia and turkey the other common type of ink in elections is indelible visible ink but as the elections in afghanistan showed improper use of this type of ink can cause additional problems the use of invisible ink is not without its own problems in most elections numerous rumors have spread about it in serbia for example both christian and islamic leaders assured their populations that its use was not contrary to religion other rumours are associated with how to remove the ink various soft drinks solvents and cleaning products are put forward however in reality the ink is very effective at getting under the cuticle of the thumb and difficult to wash off the ink stays on the finger for at least 72 hours and for up to a week the use of ink and readers by itself is not a panacea for election ills the passage of the inking law is nevertheless a clear step forward towards free and fair elections the country s widely watched parliamentary elections are scheduled for 27 february david mikosz works for the ifes an international non profit organisation that supports the building of democratic societies

0,mac mini heralds mini revolution the mac mini was launched amid much fanfare by apple and great excitement by apple watchers last month but does the latest macintosh justify the hype let us get a few things dealt with at the outset yes the mac mini is really really small and yes it is another piece of inspired apple design there is more to be said on the computer s size and design but it is worth highlighting that the mac mini is a just a computer inside that small box there is a g4 processor a cd dvd player a hard drive some other technical bits and bobs and an operating system a dvd burner wireless and bluetooth technologies can be bought at extra cost and if you do not have a monitor keyboard or mouse then you will need to purchase those also it is not the fastest computer for the money but for under 400 you are getting something more interesting than mere technical specifications apple software the mac mini comes bundled with mac os x the operating system as well as ilife 05 a suite of software which includes itunes web browser safari iphoto garage band and idvd i doubt many pc lovers would seriously argue that windows xp comes with a better suite of programs than mac os x of course users of open source operating system linux draw up their own menu of programs for people who want to do interesting things with their music photos and home movies then a mac mini is an ideal first computer or companion to a main computer it s a good little machine with a reasonable amount of power and just perfect for the average computer user who wants to leave the tyranny of window and viruses said mark sparrow technical and reviews editor at mac format magazine he added in essence it s a laptop in a biscuit tin minus the screen and the keyboard the software bundle that comes with the mini makes your average budget pc look a bit sick the relatively low price of the machine has also encouraged the more technically savvy to experiment with their macs one user has already created a dock to enable him to plug in and out his mac mini in his car the small size of the machine makes it a practical solution for in car entertainment playing movies and music as well as navigation another user has mounted his mac mini to the back of his large plasma screen and then controls the computer via a wireless keyboard and mouse when it was first announced some pundits thought the mini was designed as a sort of stealth media centre ie the machine would be used to serve tv programmes music films and photos partly due to its small living room friendly design but there are obvious reasons why this is not the case at least not in the here and now the hard drive at 80gb for the larger model is too small to be realistically used as media centre while commercial personal video recorders are on the market with smaller than 80gb hard drives it is worth remembering that they only store tv content a media centre computer has to store music files and photos and as such 80gb just seems too small most pcs running windows media center have at least 120gb hard disks coupled with the lack of a tv tuner card a digital audio out and any kind of media centre software bundled with the machine then the mac mini should be judged on what it is not what it is not but that has not stopped more enterprising users from adapting the mac mini to media centre uses so is the mac mini just another computer or a revolution in computing graham barlow editor of mac format understandably has a rather partisan viewpoint it s just a mac but we should be very excited it s revolutionary in its size smaller than pcs looks looks better than pcs and the fact that it s the first mac designed to really go for the low cost pc market the design of the mac mini is further evidence of a future when pcs are more than just bland bulky boxes there are a number of companies who already produce miniature pcs based on mini itx motherboards but at the moment these pcs tend to be either for the home build enthusiast or expensive pre built options based around microsoft s media center software but for the value the mac mini offers bringing some of the best software packages within reach of more consumers than ever before apple is to be congratulated let us say then that if the mac mini is not a fully fledged revolution it is a mini revolution

0,multi purpose tv aids india two thirds of the world s population 4 billion people live on 2 000 a year or less you might think that the last thing on their minds would be getting a television set or a computer but that s not the case many people in the developing world give up one of their daily meals so they can afford to buy a tv and now an indian born computer engineer thinks he s come up with a way to give them cheap access to the internet carnegie mellon professor raj reddy has spent the bulk of his professional career trying to find ways to make technology accessible to poor people the first step is to figure out why poor people would want a personal computer and professor reddy thinks he has a pretty good idea of why they might i come from a village says prof reddy i know what the population is like many of them are illiterate and many of them have other concerns there nobody will use it for the conventional uses of a pc word processing and powerpoint he said so it s clear to me that if people wanted to use pcs in a village it has to usable by illiterate people and it must be primarily for entertainment education telemedicine and access to expert advice prof reddy also thinks that tying it into some kind of aid package was the wrong approach after all he asked what aid group could possibly give expensive computers to 250 million less fortunate indians let alone the billions of poor people around the world instead prof reddy decided to think of those 250 million indians as a potential market the problem then becomes one of making the product compelling enough it must be so compelling that you would give up your third meal in order to have this prof reddy says people do this today with television sets if you go to india and many other countries they will first go get a television set before they worry about one more meal why because personalized entertainment has become very important this hatched a completely new idea he calls it a pctvt a personal computer television and telephone all in one that runs on a normal desktop machine literate users can surf through the applications with a keyboard and mouse but illiterate users can use what looks like a television remote control on the screen pictures not words designate applications like tv voice mail and video e mail this dependence on graphics video and audio means that a computer for an illiterate person needs 100 times more power and more memory than one for a phd prassana rambathla one of prof reddy s graduate students says that when you re talking illiterate you re talking audio and video and that demands exponentially high bandwidth it can t choke at any point in time and it has to withstand anything no matter what you re pressing the major part is making it foolproof very tough so that it never breaks he says the carnegie mellon team says this project is only possible because pcs are now so much cheaper and have built in audio and video hardware and software limited trials of the pctvt are due to start this month in the indian state of andhra pradesh although andhra pradesh has a fairly good infrastructure but work has to be done to ensure reliable connections to the net prof reddy has teamed up with eric brewer at the university of california at berkeley the answer says prof brewer is wi fi we re looking at the thing you ll see in starbuck s or many other hotspots he says we re doing a lot of work on long distance wireless and how to make the network work better in the presence of intermittency when the power goes up and down and the links go up and down and the computers you re connected to just get turned off for no reason prof reddy says he hopes to lease the pctvts for about 10 a month and thinks indians will rent the units for the television and dvd capabilities reddy says he can then introduce the pctvt s other technologies such as video mail for example a farmer could use the pctvt s webcam to send a picture of a harmful insect to a local official who could send back a proposed course of action to the farmer prof reddy thinks this kind of communication is the real pay off the underlying problem he says is how you can increase their wealth and reduce their poverty and reduce their illiteracy and improve their health care and what i m postulating is that this is the technology that will enable them if i didn t have it it would be an uphill battle even with the technology it s an uphill battle but i have a tool there is hope i can reach them in ways that have not been possible before clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world a bbc world service and wgbh boston co production
0,broadband soars in 2004 if broadband were a jumbo jet then 2003 would have seen it taxiing down the runway firing up its engines and preparing for take off but this year has seen it soar in the spring it literally took to the skies as lufthansa and british airways trialled it on flights this perhaps said more about how indispensable people were beginning to perceive the technology rather than how useful sky high broadband would actually be it was flying high and by the autumn five million britons had signed up for high speed net access at home such enthusiasm is unlikely to dampen any time soon and experts predict that by the end of next year the numbers will have risen to more than eight million or more than 30 of homes the two key factors in whetting people s appetite were falling prices and a huge marketing push when operators such as bt and telewest offered standard 512k broadband for less than 20 at the beginning of the year it was as if an invisible barrier had been breached broadband had truly gone mass market a feeding frenzy followed as firms vied for eyeballs in a price war reminiscent of that following the mass market take up of dial up broadband for less than 10 was even touted by some firms although such a low price raised eyebrows among more established companies questioning how they are able to sustain such business models for those who became broadbanders in 2004 there was no turning back and the days of waiting for the modem to kick in began to seem as outdated an idea as a jungle without celebrities the rest of the world was also falling in love with the benefits of fast internet access to the tune of 100 million connections worldwide by april prompting research firm point topic to declare it one of the fastest growing technologies ever by september the number of broadband connections in the uk finally overtook dial up and in december bt announced that it was making a new broadband connection every 10 seconds broadband was being mentioned on the 10 o clock news and in the tabloids the sun even carried a cartoon joke about it but two of the most significant pieces of news for broadband were items that did not make the headlines in may bt quietly announced that it was shaving 70 off the cost of allowing other operators access to its telephone exchanges so called local loop unbundling the vital local loop is the crucial link between telephone exchanges and homes at the moment bt has a stranglehold on more than 80 of these lines making it the key voice in deciding what adsl products get into homes with cheaper local loop unbundling rivals to bt can offer faster services that will leave the broadband of today looking positively tortoise like it will mean the uk will finally catch up with countries such as france and the netherlands where homes are routinely enjoying speeds of up to 15mb megabits per second and the major price fall means that rather than just talk about it companies are actually starting to get their own equipment into bt s exchanges it may not seem that exciting but it is a remarkable transition given that just a few years ago the arguments over local loop unbundling bore more than a passing resemblance to the northern ireland peace talks fraught bitter and with no end in sight another big piece of news for broadband users in 2004 was the extension of bt s reach meaning more than 95 of the population could get broadband regardless of how far away from the exchange they lived there was a slight caveat for those wanting to upgrade to 1mbps broadband they still have to live within six kilometres of a broadband enabled exchange for thousands frustrated by their inability to get the technology the news meant they could finally join in broadband is not just about fast access over the telephone and cable operators ntl and telewest also had a bumper year the biggest news for them was increased speeds introducing 2mb and 3mb services for users and offering a free upgrade to those on 512k the cable operators are limited in their reach and it is perhaps testament to how big a deal local loop unbundling could become that even they are considering extending their range via this route broadband can seem confusing for consumers with the huge amount of operators offering so many different products some with capped bandwidth and different length contracts and set up fees it is unlikely to get any less easy to understand in 2005 but remains a plane worth catching as it gets faster and offers extras such as cheap telephone calls online the only real thing to remember for the coming year is to enjoy the ride

1,why few targets are better than many the economic targets set out at the lisbon summit of european union leaders in 2000 were meant to help europe leapfrog its way past the united states to become the world s leading economy by 2010 but the lisbon targets are about much more than just economic prestige for many economists and analysts they are about ensuring europe doesn t become a global economic laggard they are also about ensuring europe can continue to compete as an equal with the growing economic giants of asia india and china as well as with the economic might of the united states that s why there was a tone of urgency in the report out on wednesday by the former dutch prime minister wim kok mr kok was commissioned by the european commission in march this year to assess how far the eu has come towards meeting the lisbon targets five years on from their inception his conclusion was simple too many of the targets will be seriously missed lisbon risks becoming a synonym for missed objectives and failed promises his report said the status quo is not an option at risk in the medium to long run is nothing less than the sustainability of the society europe has built it said the report comes at a time when europe s competitive position is waning the eu s economic growth rate is projected to be 2 this year and 2 4 next while there has been growth in overall employment rates in europe productivity lags behind that of the us but meeting the lisbon targets requires a political commitment that no eu member state has volunteered so far that has in part been due to the state of the global economy in the past few years as mr kok s report noted the ink had scarcely dried on the lisbon agreement before the worldwide stock market bubble imploded the us suffered two years of economic slowdown and recession and the european economy followed suit the circumstances weren t conducive to creating the 20 million new jobs promised by eu leaders in lisbon in 2000 neither were they conducive to getting governments to spend more on research and development money needed if the eu was to meet its target of becoming a so called knowledge based economy the lisbon vision is a compelling one but in order to do it society has to change said paul hofheinz of the lisbon council a brussels based citizen action group what you find is that a lot of people have been fighting change you find trade unions fighting change but also the employers associations even though they tell you they re in favour of change many are actually pushing for less competition more subsidy and less free market activity but part of the problem was also linked to the original targets set out in lisbon five years ago targets have a habit of coming back to haunt you and in the lisbon case they covered too much according to the wim report economic growth and job creation were linked to issues ranging from environmental protection to social inclusion and even safety at sea the agenda was just too broad and as a result nothing was prioritised lisbon is about everything and thus about nothing the kok report said everybody is responsible and thus no one that s why the kok report recommends that the lisbon targets be narrowed down to 14 key indicators with an emphasis on creating jobs and economic growth it also recommends that the european commission draw up a league table which ranks countries according to the steps they re taking towards meeting the targets effectively naming shaming and faming rhetoric and delivery don t necessarily go hand in hand mr kok said in a press conference alongside the publication of his report we don t have the luxury anymore just to exchange politeness with one another on one point mr kok was very clear the european union should not try to emulate the us economy the european economic and social model needs to change but not so much so that social and environmental issues take a backseat to economic growth in that sense the lisbon agenda is sailing into unchartered waters the kok report tries to do away with a belief that jobs need to be sacrificed at the altar of economic growth it s very ambitious said john palmer political director at the european policy centre a brussels based think tank this is something that no advanced economy in the world has tried to do it s going to require quite new and innovative policies but some analysts believe that the kok report doesn t come up with the sort of innovative policies and thinking needed to make the lisbon targets a reality for example it recommends putting in place policies which encourage women and older people to remain in the workforce but it doesn t say how companies should be convinced to do this it will be up to the incoming president of the european commission jose manuel barroso to adopt mr kok s recommendations and press them on eu governments mr barroso has said that the eu s competitiveness will be his top priority he expects his five year term in office to be judged on europe s success in meeting the lisbon agenda

0,how to make a greener computer the hi tech industry is starting to get more environmentally aware bill thompson thinks it s about time my first car ran on four star petrol and pumped vast quantities of lead into the atmosphere as i drove around cambridge now you can t buy petrol with lead additives and we re all better off as a result chip giant intel recently began shipping computer circuit boards that are lead free too reflecting a growing awareness on the part of the technology industry that products have to be designed and built in more environmentally friendly ways apart from reducing the use of toxic materials like arsenic mercury cadmium and other heavy metals in the products themselves the manufacturing process is also being cleaned up with fewer complex and potentially damaging organic chemicals used as solvents and work is going into making power supplies that are more energy efficient since current transformers are astonishingly wasteful as they charge our laptops mobiles and music players one of the key aspects of the new approach is to design products that are easier to recycle if you have got a phone or a computer with toxic chemicals or heavy metals in it then extracting them can be tricky and expensive a well designed electronic component is able to be recycled at low cost this is going to be very important to hardware manufacturers in europe since from august the new waste electronic and electrical equipment directive will oblige them to accept returned products for recycling they will end up paying if they build things that are expensive or impossible to take apart and will find their profits hit something which is likely to motivate them where appeals to the wider public interest might fall on deaf ears it is as they say about time we have a long and depressing history of developing new technologies with complete disregard for their potential impact on the environment and waiting until there is a crisis looming before we try to redesign them to cause less damage the car engine is a case in point lead additives helped stop petrol vapour exploding too early in the cylinder a phenomenon called knocking so they were simply used without any real thought for the fact that the lead would end up in the atmosphere redesigning engines and making petrol slightly different was a lot more work so it took decades before it was done we re seeing the same thing in the technology industry and as a result there are billions of devices from old mobile phones to antique handhelds that will have to be recycled in years to come if apple gets its way then a lot of people are going to be buying a new mac mini and throwing away their old pc keeping the monitor and other peripherals even if apple does not get its way four or five year old computers are not good enough to run modern programs and it s not unreasonable to replace them but what do we do with the old ones i ve just looked around my office and i find two monitors an old 386 pc two old handhelds three ancient laptops four antique mobile phones a collection of rechargeable batteries and even a sun workstation that is no longer really much use they are all old enough to be hazardous waste the monitors alone will be full of arsenic and lead but it s possible that some of the components could be useful i could take them up the to the council recycling centre but it s a 10 mile drive away across town and like many other people my commitment to recycling is shallow at best here in cambridge we have green bins for compostable waste a box for glass cans and paper that can be recycled and a black bin for the rest there are bottle banks and clothing banks scattered around town and in supermarket car parks would it be too much to ask for an electronics recycling box too i d probably remember to take my old mobile with me to the supermarket and drop it in a box at least eventually bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital

0,mobiles get set for visual radio the growth in the mobile phone market in the past decade has been nothing less than astonishing but the ability to communicate on the go is not the only reason we are hooked games cameras and music players have all been added to our handsets in the last few years but 2005 could see another big innovation that won t just see a change in our mobile phone habits it might alter the way we listen to the radio finnish handset giant nokia has been working on a technology called visual radio which takes an existing fm signal from a radio station and enables that station to add enhancements such as information and pictures it is not the first time that such an idea has been suggested the early days of dab digital radio had similar intentions that never really saw the light of day one problem is that the name visual radio leads people to think of television but reidar wasenius a senior project manager at nokia was adamant that visual radio should not be confused with the more traditional medium he said i m very happy to say it s not television what we re talking about is an enhancement of radio as we know it today if you have a visual radio enabled handset when you hear an artist you don t know or there s a competition or vote that you d like to participate in you pull out your handset and with one click you turn on a visual channel parallel to the on air broadcast you ve just been listening to that visual channel is run from a computer within the radio station and sends out different kinds of information to the handset depending on what you are listening to as well as details on the track or artist of a particular song there is also the ability to interact immediately with the radio station itself in a similar way to digital television s red button content possible interactive content includes competitions votes and even the chance to rate the song that is playing but the interactive aspect will make the service especially attractive to radio stations who will be able to track the number of people taking part in such activities on a real time basis this in turn should lead to an additional source of revenue as it is very likely that advertisers will be keen to exploit new opportunities to reach listeners as the visual radio content is transmitted by existing gprs technology you would need to have that service enabled by your network and there will be a cost for the service as well although it may depend on your usage if you enjoy the visual channel occasionally and interact it ll be two or three pounds per month said mr wasenius but typically what we see happening is the operator offering a package deal for an all you can eat arrangement per month the payment system could therefore be similar to the way that broadband internet works versus dial up connections one thing that is for sure assuming that nokia retains its market share in handsets it is estimating that there will be 100 million visual radio enabled mobile phones in circulation by the end of 2006 basically visual radio is not really revolutionary but rather an evolution where we are providing tools with which people can participate in radio much more easily than ever before the first visual radio service in the uk will begin in a few months time with virgin radio who are positive about the impact it could have on their listeners station manager steve taylor commented listeners can interact with the radio station in a new way not only does this give listeners more information on the music we play but means they can instantly purchase things they like mp3 music downloads and the latest gig tickets initially visual radio functionality will be limited to two nokia handsets due out soon the 3230 and 7710 but if successful it is very likely that other manufacturers will want to join them listen again to the interview on the radio five live website

4,prime minister s questions so who if anyone is playing politics with the security of the nation michael howard has no doubt it is the prime minister who he claims is ramming through parliament the controversial new anti terror measures without proper debate he didn t say so but the tories believe the prime minister is playing the fear card on this one so he can look tough in the run up to the general election and they believe tony blair is using the issue to suggest the tories are soft on terrorism why on earth will the prime minister not simply take up the tories offer to extend the existing powers temporarily to allow proper parliamentary debate of the laws he demanded the prime minister claims this is the clearest indication that it is the tories who are playing politics with the issue by attempting to score cheap political points in parliament is not the opposition against to the proposed laws in principle in which case delaying a decision for further debate would be pointless what this is really about believes mr blair is the tories spotting an opportunity to embarrass maybe even defeat the government and that is more important to them than national security liberal democrat leader charles kennedy avoided suggesting anyone was playing politics with the issue he preferred to state that as with other issues like id cards the government s immediate instinct was authoritarian as is his habit nowadays the prime minister was less rough with mr kennedy than he had been with mr howard he prefers a more exasperated tone suggesting he believes the lib dems have once again just missed the point apart from all that it was electioneering as usual the very first question to the prime minister from derby north s bob laxton asked him in effect if he would carry on the excellent policy of pouring more resources into schools later birmingham s sion simon even went so far as to suggest the tories were such a shower that we should have the general election now the prime minister almost blushed this was not the appropriate place to announce election day he stammered but can anyone be in any doubt that that announcement is just days away an announcement coming in the week beginning 4 april for an election on 5 may is where the big money is in the commons and perhaps that simple fact alone means everyone is seen to be playing politics with just about everything at the moment

2,ireland win eclipses refereeing errors the international rugby board may have to step in to stop frustrated coaches and players from publicly haranguing referees when things go belly up it may have to go the whole way and have nfl style video cameras all over the field or slap the vociferous perpetrators over the knuckles what the irb does not want is a football scenario where the verbal slanging matches often overshadow the game itself sunday s explosive six nations clash at lansdowne road was a good example as ireland took another step towards their first grand slam since 1948 the game was as exciting as it comes with a much improved england side enraged at a few decisions that did not go their way one can understand that frustration there was no doubt that ireland had the rub of the green in their 19 13 victory but the reaction from the england camp may not have endeared them to the sport s blazers referee jonathan kaplan was not perfect by any means and two decisions in particular made him the villain of the piece i doubt whether kaplan would have been too pleased at the comments made after all he has no public recourse to criticism it was the same for simon mcdowell the touch judge who was heavily criticised by scotland coach matt williams after their defeat against france as far as england were concerned there were queries over mark cueto s first half effort when he went over in the corner from a charlie hodgson kick england coach andy robinson referred to a similar case at ravenhill in january when ulster were playing gloucester in the heineken cup on that occasion david humphreys kicked to tommy bowe who touched down in the corner only for the try to be wiped out but you cannot have cameras at every conceivable angle to pick up such anomalies perhaps robinson was right to say the referee should have gone upstairs when josh lewsey was driven over the irish line near the end lewsey claims he touched it down and was in full control however one has to credit ireland flanker johnny o connor for cleverly scooping the ball away and blocking any evidence of a touchdown but in rugby everything tends to even out over the 80 minutes the referee also missed england s danny grewcock taking out ronan o gara off the ball to allow martin corry a sunday stroll to the line those were the stand out moments in a classic game between the two old foes but there were many more and one should not take away from those brian o driscoll s winning try was as well conceived as they come while charlie hodgson s brilliant kicking display was another highlight and ronan o gara s tremendous ability to control the game was also a crucial component but the defining moments came with ireland under the cosh in the final 15 minutes two outstanding pieces of defensive play denied england and allowed ireland to hold on the first was denis hickie s brilliant double tackle in the right hand corner he gobbled up cueto from another hodgson cross field kick then regained his feet to stop lewsey from scoring a certain try ireland s second row colossus paul o connell was equally superb england had turned ireland one way then the other and the defence cordon was slowly disintegrating england prop matt stevens ran in at full steam to suck in a few more tacklers unfortunately he ran into o connell who hit him hard very hard and then wrestled the ball away for a crucial turnover that spoke volumes about ireland s back foot display with defensive coach mike ford taking a bow at the end to win a game like that showed that ireland have moved forward it may be tries that win games but it is defence that wins championships
4,falconer rebuts charade claims concessions on a bill which critics claim would allow euthanasia through the back door were not a political ploy the lord chancellor has said ministers have been accused of panic in offering last minute changes to the mental capacity bill amid chaotic scenes in the commons on tuesday lord falconer said it was fair to criticise the late timing of the offer he said the changes provided a solution to a very difficult issue but some mps argue the situation is still unclear the bill allows people to give somebody the power of attorney to make decisions on their behalf if they become too ill to decide for themselves ministers insist the plans would not change laws on euthanasia and would improve safeguards critics fear it could allow killing by omission through withdrawing treatment including food and fluids tony blair said he would do everything he could to meet concerns about the bill but changes to the bill must not overturn the law set when a court ruled that doctors could withdraw artificial feeding and hydration from hillsborough coma victim tony bland it is important we don t end up in the situation where doctors and consultants are confused about the law and may lay themselves open to prosecution in circumstances where no sensible person would want that to happen he said on tuesday the government saw off a backbench attempt to force changes to the bill by 297 votes to 203 despite rebellion by 34 labour mps the revolt was also reduced by news that lord falconer had promised the catholic archbishop of cardiff to strengthen safeguards in the bill but that only came after mps bombarded constitutional affairs minister david lammy with a barrage of requests for him to read the letter as they complained they had been left in the dark eventually he was hurriedly handed the letter to read out five minutes before the crunch votes prompting claims of a shambles the deputy speaker later said the debate had not been handled as it should have been lord falconer says there will be amendments when the bill goes to the house of lords he told bbc news we have given a commitment to put into the bill a clause that says that nothing in the bill authorises any act where the motive of the person authorising the decision is to end life the motive has got to be to end suffering he denied the concessions were a political manoeuvre forced by panic about the rebellion it was inevitable that minds became more focused as the bill went through parliament but the result was a sensible solution he said i don t think it is something to be embarrassed about these issues are not easy to deal with he went on bbc political editor andrew marr said mr lammy was waste deep in quicksand and sinking fast after his performance but lord falconer praised his minister for an excellent job former conservative leader iain duncan smith one of the chief critics of the plans condemned the debate as a charade and complained the promises of changes to the bill were vague

1,making your office work for you our mission to brighten up your working lives continues and this time we re taking a long hard look at your offices over the next few months our panel of experts will be listening to your gripes about where you work and suggesting ways to make your workspace more efficient more congenial or simply prettier this week we re hearing from marianne petersen who is planning to convert a barn in sweden into a base for her freelance writing work click on the link under her photograph to read her story and then scroll down to see what the panel have to say and if you want to take part in the series go to the bottom of the story to find out how to get in touch working from home presents a multitude of challenges understanding your work personality allows you to work in terms of your own style do you feel confident about your work output without conferring with others are you able to retain discipline and self motivate to get the job done do you build on the ideas of others or are you a more introspective problem solver in order for a virtual office to succeed keeping the boundary between work and home life is essential it may be useful to be quite rigid about who is allowed to visit and to keep strict office hours referring to the space as work will give those around you a clear message that this is professional space it is imperative to consider how to bring the outside world into yours keeping up to date with developments and maintaining a network isolated work environments mean this has to be carefully thought out and a strategy has to be developed that suits both your personality and your industry joining professional groups or forming a loose association of like minded people may assist it is useful to structure these meetings in advance as often they get relegated to less important status when times are busy with the danger that when the workload eases they have to be resurrected prior to any interior work being undertaken it is essential to ensure that the roof and walls are made water and weather tight and the structure is checked for stability it appears that the roof trusses may need repairs and additional bracing ideally the roof should be replaced with an outer material in keeping with the character and location of the barn this would also allow for a well insulated inner skin to be provided which should be light coloured it is likely that the most efficient way of heating the building is with electricity in order to provide this the owner will need to have an electrical engineer calculate the potential heating power and lighting load to make sure the mains supply and distribution capacity are adequate ideally it would be good to have a mains water supply and some means of drainage for toilet and washing facilities the walls should be dry lined with a single skin of plasterboard laid over rockwool slab which will allow good wall insulation and the power and lighting circuits to be concealed and the walls should be painted in a light colour the owner mentions she might lay a new floor over the existing planks this will improve the insulation and offer a level surface i would suggest laying new oak veneer planks which can work in with the character of the barn as for lighting consider a combination of floor mounted uplights wall lights wall washers and selected downlights use a combination of mains voltage fluorescent fittings and dimmable units which can vary the light levels and the feel of the interior please click on the link to the right here to see my ideas for marianne s barn the layout of this office reflects the need to have a working area and a more relaxed meeting space large desk space and extensive storage would combine with tub chairs to maximise the space available the finishes chosen for the furniture will need to reflect the unusual setting while the lighting and temperature control mechanisms used will further influence the workplace regarding accessing the internet via the connection in the main house your plan of going wireless is sensible a wireless router access point in the house with a wireless lan card in the pc in the renovated area may be sufficient however important points to consider are the distance between the two buildings and the nature of the materials through which the signals have to pass which could result in a weak signal strength you may require an additional wireless access point in the renovated area your local it supplier will be able to advise on this if you haven t already invested in robust firewall and anti virus software it is essential to do so to protect your investment to really take advantage of wireless technology you might consider a laptop computer and a docking station with external mouse and monitor or you could use one of the new tablet computers which allow you to write directly on the screen and convert into text with built in hand recognition software and finally you will save money and space by considering a multi function product for print scan copy and fax

0,peer to peer nets here to stay peer to peer p2p networks are here to stay and are on the verge of being exploited by commercial media firms says a panel of industry experts once several high profile legal cases against file sharers are resolved this year firms will be very keen to try and make money from p2p technology the expert panel probed the future of p2p at the consumer electronics show in las vegas earlier in january the first convictions for p2p piracy were handed out in the us in january william trowbridge and michael chicoine pleaded guilty to charges that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music movies and software since the first successful file sharing network napster was forced to close down the entertainment industry has been nervous and critical of p2p technology blaming it for falling sales and piracy but that is going to change very soon according to the panel the music and film industries have started some big legal cases against owners of legitimate p2p networks which are not illegal in themselves and of individuals accused of distributing pirated content over networks but they have slowly realised that p2p is a good way to distribute content said travis kalanick founder and chairman of p2p network red swoosh and soon they are all going to want a slice of it they are just waiting to come up with business models that work for them which includes digital rights management and copy protection standards but until the legal actions are resolved experimentation with p2p cannot not happen said michael weiss president of streamcast networks remembering the furore around vcrs when they first came out mr weiss said old media always tries to stop new media when they can t stop it they try to control it then they figure out how to make money and they always make a lot of money once the courts decided that the vcr in itself was not an illegal technology the film studios turned it into an extremely lucrative business in august 2004 the san francisco based us court of appeals ruled in favour of grokster and streamcast two file sharing networks the court said they were essentially in the same position that sony was in the 1980s vcr battle and said that the networks themselves could not be deemed as illegal p2p networks usually do not rely on dedicated servers for the transfer of files instead it uses direct connections between computers or clients there are now many different types of p2p systems than work in different ways p2p nets can be used to share any kind of file like photos free software licensed music and any other digital content the bbc has already decided to embrace the technology it aims to offer most of its own programmes for download this year and it will use p2p technology to distribute them the files would be locked seven days after a programme aired making rights management easier to control but the technology is still demonised and misunderstood by many the global entertainment industry says more than 2 6 billion copyrighted music files are downloaded every month and about half a million films are downloaded a day legal music download services like apple itunes napster have rushed into the music marketplace to try and lure file sharers away from free content sales of legally downloaded songs grew tenfold in 2004 with 200 million tracks bought online in the us and europe in 12 months the ifpi reported this week but such download services are very different from p2p networks not least because of the financial aspect there are several money spinning models that could turn p2p into a golden egg for commercial entertainment companies paid for pass along in which firms receive money each time a file is shared along with various drm solutions and advertiser based options are all being considered we see there are going to be different models for commoditising p2p said marc morgenstern vice president of anti piracy firm overpeer consumers are hungry for it and we will discover new models together agreed mr morgenstern but many net users will continue to ignore the entertainment industry s potential controlling grip on content and p2p technology by continuing to use it for their own creations unsigned bands for example use p2p networks to distribute their music effectively which also draws the attention of record companies looking for new artists to sign increasingly what you are seeing on p2p is consumer created content said derek broes from microsoft they will probably play an increasing role in helping p2p spread he said looking into p2p s future file sharing is just the beginning for p2p networks as far as mr broes is concerned once some of these issues are resolved you are going to see aggressive movement to protect content but also in ways that are unimaginable now he said file sharing is the tip of the iceberg

1,gsk aims to stop aids profiteers one of the world s largest manufacturers of hiv aids drugs has launched an initiative to combat the smuggling of cheaper pills supplied to poorer african countries back into europe for resale at far higher price the company glaxosmithkline is to alter the packaging and change the colour of the pills currently provided to developing nations under a humanitarian agreement it is estimated that drugs companies are losing hundreds of millions of dollars each year as a result of the diversion of their products in this way this is a very sensitive area for the big drugs companies they want to maintain their profits but have been put under tremendous pressure to provide cheap anti aids drugs to the world s poorest nations the result is that drugs supplied to africa are now more than thirty times cheaper than those sold in europe bringing these medicines within the reach of millions of hiv positive africans through their government s health care systems but the wide difference in price also means that there are big gains to be made from illegally diverting these cheaper drugs back into wealthier countries and re selling them at a higher price glaxosmithkline believes that by coating the pills destined for africa in a red dye and adding new identification codes both onto the pills and on the packaging then this trade can be substantially reduced the company says that it will then be possible to identify specific distributors in africa who have re sold humanitarian drugs for profit as well as those suppliers in europe that have also been involved in the trade glaxo says distribution of the new look drugs has already begun and that their chemical content is identical to those currently being sold in europe

4,amnesty chief laments war failure the lack of public outrage about the war on terror is a powerful indictment of the failure of human rights groups amnesty international s chief has said in a lecture at the london school of economics irene khan said human rights had been flouted in the name of security since 11 september 2001 she said the human rights movement had to use simpler language both to prevent scepticism and spread a moral message and it had to fight poverty not just focus on political rights for elites ms khan highlighted detentions without trial including those at the us camp at guantanamo bay in cuba and the abuse of prisoners as evidence of increasing human rights problems what s a new challenge is the way in which this age old debate on security and human rights has been translated into the language of war she said by using the language of war human rights are being sidelined because we know human rights do not apply in times of war ms khan said such breaches were infectious and were now seen in almost very major country in the world the human rights movement faces a crisis of faith in the value of human rights she said that was accompanied by a crisis of governance where the united nations system did not seem able to hold countries to account the amnesty secretary general said a growing gap between the perceived influence of human rights group and what they could actually achieve was fuelling scepticism public passivity on the war against terror is the single most powerful indictment on the failures of human rights groups she said ms khan said the movement had failed to mobilise public outrage about what was happening to the human rights system there needed to be a drive to use simpler language talking about the basic morality of the issues rather than the complexity of legal processes such efforts could make the issues more relevant to people across the world she said the human rights groups also had to recognise there were new groups which had to be tackled in new ways as power dripped away from state governments al qaeda for example was not going to be impressed by a traditional amnesty letter writing campaign more also needed to be done to develop a human rights framework for international business corporations amnesty international members voted in 2001 to extend the organisation s work from political and civil rights to cover social and economic rights too ms khan said the human rights movement would make itself irrelevant if it turned away from the suffering caused by economic strife we would be an elitist bunch working for the elites for those who cannot read the newspaper of their choice rather than those who cannot read she said despite her concerns ms khan dubbed herself a hope monger saying she was confident the passions of the human rights movement could overcome the new challenges

4,fido to be taken off vote lists the risk of pets and children being given votes could be cut by changing how people register to vote the uk elections watchdog has said those are some of the mistakes found under the current system where one person in each household applies for voting forms for the other occupants the electoral commission says enabling people to register individually could cut some errors and combat fraud voters need to register by 11 march if the next poll is on 5 may as expected but any individual registration scheme would not be introduced in britain before that general election the proposed scheme would mean voters using individual identifiers when they vote such as their own voting number date of birth and signature the electoral commission says having voters register individually rather than the head of household do it for them fits better with human rights laws chairman sam younger told mps on tuesday care was needed to ensure that people were not lost off the register in the process which happened when northern ireland switched to a similar system there have been rare cases when household pets have been put on the electoral roll the mps heard and some people have registered all their family regardless of their age birth dates are not included on the forms so election officers cannot easily check non british citizens who are not entitled to vote have also been registered in some cases mr younger said there was anecdotal evidence of inaccuracies in the register the vast majority of which were caused by genuine mistakes he argued local councils could look harder at promoting targeted campaigns at hard to reach voters for example some authorities already run such programmes but in others councillors worry about the party political impact of encouraging particular areas to turn out mr younger said using the royal mail s postal redirection service had already helped election officers retrace about 50 000 voters he argued individual registration would also increase security for postal ballots and other new ways of voting there have been fears there are too few checks to ensure current postal votes are cast by the person on the voting form he said it might also help register students in halls of residences where the hall warden often has to do the job for everybody the mps on the office of the deputy prime minister and constitutional affairs select committees pressed mr younger on how to avoid losing voters in any changeover he said the northern ireland example illustrated real difficulties to be confronted currently british voters have to re register to vote every year or face being removed from the electoral rolls if they fail to do so two years running mr younger suggested the re registration could happen less frequently but argued efforts were needed to check the electoral rolls were up to date

0,tv s future down the phone line internet tv has been talked about since the start of the web as we know it now but any early attempts to do it the uk s home choice started in 1992 were thwarted by the lack of a fast network now that broadband networks are bedding down and it is becoming essential for millions the big telcos are keen to start shooting video down the line in the face of competition from cable companies offering net voice calls they are keen to be the top iptv dogs software giant microsoft thinks iptv internet protocol tv is the future of television and it sits neatly with its vision of the connected entertainment experience telcos have been wanting to do video for a long time ed graczyk director of marketing for microsoft iptv told the bbc news website the challenge has been the broadband network and the state of technology up until not so long ago did not add up to a feasible solution compression technology was not efficient enough the net was not good enough a lot of stars have aligned in the last 18 months to make it a reality last year he said was all about deal making and partnering up shaping the iptv ecosystem this year those deals will start to play out and more services will come online 2006 is where it starts ramping up and expanding to other geographies over time as broadband becomes more prevalent in south america and other parts of asia it will expand he added what telcos really want to do is to send the triple play of video voice and data down one single line be it cable or dsl digital subscriber line some are talking about quadruple play too with mobile services added into the mix it is an emerging new breed of competition for satellite and cable broadcasters and operators according to technology analysts tdg research there will be 20 million subscribers to iptv services in under six years key to the appeal of sending tv programmes down the same line as the web data whenever a viewer wants it is that it uses the same technology as the internet it means there is not just a one way relationship between the viewer and the broadcaster this allows for more dvd like interactivity limitless storage and broadcast space bespoke channel playlists and thousands of hours of programmes or films at a viewer s fingertips it potentially lets operators target programmes to smaller niche or localised audiences sending films to bollywood fans for instance as well as individual devices operators could also send high definition programmes straight to the viewer bypassing the need for a special broadcast receiver perhaps most compelling yet some might say insignificant is instantaneous channel flicking currently there is a delay when you try to do this on satellite cable or freeview with iptv the speed is 15 milliseconds that gets rounds of applause according to mr graczyk microsoft is one of the companies that started thinking about iptv some time ago we believe this will be the way all tv is delivered in the future but that is several years away said mr graczyk as with music tv has moved to digital formats the things software can do to integrate media into devices means a whole new generation of connected entertainment experiences that cross devices from the tv to the mobile to the gaming console and so on the company intends its microsoft s iptv edition software an end to end management and delivery platform to let telcos to do exactly that seamlessly it has netted seven major telcos as customers representing a potential audience of 25 million existing broadband subscribers its deal with us telco sbc was the largest tv software deal to date said mr graczyk iptv is about more than telcos though there are several web based offerings that aim to put control in the hands of the consumer by exploiting the net s power jeremy allaire chief of brightcove told the bbc news website that it would be a flavour of iptv that was about harnessing the web as a channel it is not just niches but about exploiting content not usually viewed he said we are focussed on the owners of video content who have rights to digitally distribute content and who often see unencumbered distribution for them to do it through cable and so on is price prohibitive he said this type of iptv service might also be a distribution channel for more established publishers who have unique types of content that they cannot offer through cable and satellite operators history channel archives for instance what is a clear sign that iptv has a future is that microsoft is not the only player in the field there are a lot of other middleware players providing similar management services as microsoft like myrio and c cor but it will up to the viewer to decide if it really is to be successful

2,time to get tough on friendlies for an international manager a friendly provides an important opportunity to work with your players the only problem is that the game itself can often be a farce some people have been saying it would be better to get the players together for the week and do away with the 90 minutes at the end i would say it s 50 50 whether you should have these games or not and if you look at it that way you would probably say you re better not doing so it would certainly keep club managers happy as it would reduce the risk of players returning to domestic duty injured but international bosses will tell you that scrapping friendlies is counterproductive because the only way for a team to get better is by playing the more you play together the easier it is when it comes to the crunch in games like world cup quarter finals against brazil often in friendlies though a manager will play his strongest side for the first 45 minutes and then send out an entirely different one in the second half and it s very difficult for any player to come on as substitute in a side with a few changes let alone a whole team s worth the debate will rage on and i m not sure there is a satisfactory solution one manager who has got it right this week is walter smith the new scotland manager has decided to have a training camp instead of a friendly for his first international week since replacing berti vogts it is the sort of move you would expect from walter who is a canny manager the players have had such a hard time recently that he is better off getting them together in a relaxed atmosphere and trying to generate some team spirit before the next world cup qualifiers if he had sent them out on wednesday and they had been badly beaten it would have done them no good whatsoever john toshack has his first game in charge of wales and it will be important for him to get a decent result against hungary he will have his own ideas on individuals and how to play and will probably look more at the performance but the public wants results it s extremely difficult to get the balance for friendlies if you win people forget them but if you lose it becomes a stat that can be used against you england s game against holland is a good example it looks like a good opportunity to try out players like middlesbrough winger stewart downing or crystal palace striker andy johnson but you have got to remember sven goran eriksson s side were given a lesson by spain in the last game they played the injury problems in defence should at least give the likes of wes brown and jamie carragher a chance to impress for the club managers it will simply be a case of waiting at home with fingers crossed
0,ban hits half life 2 pirates hard about 20 000 people have been banned from playing the half life 2 game game maker valve shut down the online accounts of the players because it had evidence that their copy of the game had been obtained illegally copies of half life 2 had been circulating on file sharing systems soon after it was officially released experts said the success of the half life 2 anti piracy system might tempt other game makers into creating their own version half life 2 was officially released on 16 november but before gamers could get to grips with the long awaited title they were forced to authenticate their copy of the game online authentication involved setting up an account with valve s gaming community system called steam and letting that check which copy of the game was being run in a statement detailing the banning of the accounts valve said this system helped identify who had got hold of pirated copies the method used was extremely easy for valve to trace and confirm and so there is no question that the accounts disabled were used to try and illegally obtain half life 2 read the statement valve spokesman doug lombardi said that the company had not yet released sales figures for the game and would not say what proportion of all steam players the 20 000 represented one effect of steam s popularity has been to limit the copies of the game sold in shops and artificially depress the game s ranking in the top ten even so the title debuted at no 3 in the uk charts valve also said that a small number of accounts were closed because people were using stolen credit cards to buy copies of the game or were using stolen steam accounts some of those who have been banned by the move protested their innocence in the online forums on the main steam site and said they were being punished for what other people did with their account some contributors to the forums wondered if the action might force more piracy as people tried to get hold of successive copies of the game to keep ahead of valve s anti piracy actions in its statement valve also said that rumours that it distributed fake half life 2 keys copies of the game or instructions on how to hack the game just to catch pirates and cheats were false the company said the hack came from the community as do they all it added that most of those banned simply tried to use copies of half life 2 circulating on file swapping systems such as bit torrent rather than use hacks to get around the need for cd keys rob fahey editor of online news site gamesindustry biz said the mass banning showed off the power of the steam system before now he said it has been hard for game makers to do anything about piracy once the game was being played but with this valve is taking really effective steps against people using illegitimate copies of half life 2 he said if steam proves effective at cutting the piracy of games to a minimum said mr fahey other game makers may be tempted to set up copycat systems it s not hard to see a point in the near future when every publisher wants you to run an application on your system purely to allow you to play their games he said this could mean that computers get cluttered with poorly written steam type systems that are used to batter people with adverts unless game firms were careful he said they could face a backlash from consumers who soon get tired of maintaining different accounts for every game they play

4,butler launches attack on blair former civil service chief lord butler has criticised the way tony blair s government operates accusing it of being obsessed with headlines he also attacked the way the iraq war was sold to the public with important warnings on the strength of the intelligence left out tory leader michael howard said lord butler had given the most damaging testimony he could remember but downing street said mr blair should be judged by results not his style lord butler said mr blair bypassed the cabinet and relied instead on small informal groups of advisers to help him make decisions the prime minister s official spokesman said the cabinet was still used to achieve a consensus on important issues but he added you cannot in a modern government take every decision in cabinet it s just not possible lord butler said the government had too much freedom to bring in bad bills and to do whatever it likes and it relied too much on the advice of political appointees the former cabinet secretary said in an interview with the spectator magazine i would be critical of the present government in that there is too much emphasis on selling there is too much central control and there is too little of what i would describe as reasoned deliberation which brings in all the arguments mr howard described lord butler s intervention as very important this is from someone who was an insider at the very heart of the blair government it is certainly the most damaging testimony i can ever remember from someone in such an eminent position lord butler s report earlier this year into iraq intelligence said the government s september 2002 weapons dossier did not make clear intelligence about claims that saddam hussein had stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons was very thin the reason for this is that it would have weakened ministers case for war lord butler said in his spectator interview which was conducted by the magazine s editor conservative mp boris johnson he said when civil servants give material to ministers they say these are the conclusions we ve drawn but we ve got to tell you the evidence we ve got is pretty thin similarly if you are giving something to the united nations and the country you should warn them asked why he thought the warnings were not there lord butler said one has got to remember what the purpose of the dossier was the purpose of the dossier was to persuade the british why the government thought iraq was a very serious threat when asked whether he thought the country was well governed on the whole he replied well i think we are a country where we suffer very badly from parliament not having sufficient control over the executive and that is a very grave flaw we should be breaking away from the party whip the executive is much too free to bring in a huge number of extremely bad bills a huge amount of regulation and to do whatever it likes and whatever it likes is what will get the best headlines tomorrow all that is part of what is bad government in this country lord butler s assessment was backed by his predecessor as cabinet secretary lord armstrong lord armstrong told bbc two s newsnight i agree there doesn t appear to be the sort of informed collective political judgement brought to bear on decision making that those affected by decisions are entitled to expect liberal democrat deputy leader menzies campbell said he thought lord butler s comments were well justified and mr blair s style of leadership was corrosive of the whole system of government but labour former minister jack cunningham accused lord butler of basing his comments on the first eight months of the incoming labour administration when he was cabinet secretary mr cunningham told bbc radio 4 s today programme taken together robin butler s comments are partial inaccurate and cannot be taken as anything other than politically biased against the labour government

0,solutions to net security fears fake bank e mails or phishing and stories about id theft are damaging the potential of using the net for online commerce say e business experts trust in online security is falling as a result almost 70 of those asked in a poll said that net firms are not doing enough to protect people the survey of more than 1 000 people reported that 43 were not willing to hand over personal information online it is worrying for shopaholics and firms who want to exploit the net more people are becoming aware of online security issues but they have little confidence that companies are doing enough to counter the threats said security firm rsa which carried out the poll an estimated 12 million britons now use the net as a way of managing their financial affairs security experts say that scare stories and the vulnerabilities dogging e commerce and e banking are being taken seriously by banks in particular i don t think the threat is overplayed barry beal global security manager for capgemini told the bbc news website he added the challenge for banks is to provide the customer with something that improves security but balances that with usability ensuring extra security measures are in place protects them too as well as the individual and it is up to both parties to make sure they do what is necessary to prevent fraud he said card issuers will keep us informed of types of attacks and what procedure to take to protect ourselves if we do that they will indemnify us he said many believe using login details like usernames and passwords are simply not good enough anymore though one of the biggest challenges to improving security online is how to authenticate an individual s identity several security companies have developed methods which complement or replace passwords which are easily compromised and easy to forget last year a street survey found that more than 70 of people would reveal their password for a bar of chocolate on average people have to remember four different passwords some resort to using the same one for all their online accounts those who use several passwords often write them down and hide them in a desk or in a document on their computer in a separate survey by rsa 80 said they were fed up with passwords and would like a better way to login to work computer systems for many the ideal is a single online identity that can be validated once with a series of passwords and questions or some biometric measurement like a fingerprint or iris scan with a token like a smartcard activcard is just one of the many companies like rsa security which has been trying to come up with just that rsa has a deal with internet provider aol that lets people pay monthly for a one time passcode generation service users get a physical token which automatically generates a code which stays active for 60 seconds many companies use a token based method already for employees to access networks securely already activcard s method is more complex it is currently trailing its one time passcode generation technology with uk banks steve ash from activcard told the bbc news website there are two parts to the process of identification the most difficult is to ascertain whether an individual is who they say they are when they are online the end solution is to provide a method where you combine something the user knows with something they have and present those both the method it has developed makes use of the chip embedded in bank cards and a special card reader which can generate unique codes that are active for a specified amount of time this can be adjusted at any time and can be active for as little as 30 seconds before it changes it combines that with usual usernames and passwords as well as other security questions you take the card put it in the reader enter your pin number and a code is given if you wanted then to transfer funds for instance you would have to have the code to authorise the transaction the clever bit happens back at the bank s secure servers the code is validated by the bank s systems matching the information they expect with the customer s unique key each individual gets a key which is unique to them it is a 2048 bit long number that is virtually impossible to crack said mr ash it means that in a typical security attack explains mr ash even if password information is captured by a scammer using keystroke software or just through spoof websites they need the passcode by the time they go back to use the information the code has expired so they can t prove who they are according to mr ash in the next few years mr ash predicts that this kind of method will be commonplace before we see biometric authentication that is acceptable for widespread use pcs will have readers built into them the cost of readers will be very cheap and more people will have the cards the gadgets we carry around like personal digital assistants pdas and mobiles could also have integrated card reader technology in them the pda or phone method is a possible alternative as people are always carrying phones around he said

0,be careful how you code a new european directive could put software writers at risk of legal action warns former programmer and technology analyst bill thompson if it gets its way the dutch government will conclude its presidency of the european union by pushing through a controversial measure that has been rejected by the european parliament lacks majority support from national governments and will leave millions of european citizens in legal limbo and facing the possibility of court cases against them if the new law was about border controls defence or even the new constitution then our tv screens would be full of experts agonising over the impact on our daily lives sadly for those who will be directly affected the controversy concerns the patenting of computer programs a topic that may excite the bloggers campaigning groups and technical press but does not obsess middle britain after all how much fuss can you generate about the directive on the patentability of computer implemented inventions and the way it amends article 52 of the 1973 european patent convention yet if the new directive is nodded through at the next meeting of one of the eu s ministerial councils as seems likely it will allow programs to be patented in europe just as they are in the us many observers of the computing scene including myself think the results will be disastrous for small companies innovative programmers and the free and open source software movement it will let large companies patent all sorts of ideas and give legal force to those who want to limit their competitors use of really obvious ideas in the us you cannot build a system that stores customer credit card details so that they can pay without having to re enter them unless amazon lets you because they hold the patent on one click online purchase it is a small invention but amazon made it to the patent office first and now owns it we are relatively free from this sort of thing over here but perhaps not for long the new proposals go back to 2002 although argument about patentability of software and computer implemented inventions has been going on since at least the mid 1980s they have come to a head now after a year in which proposals were made endorsed by the council of ministers radically modified by the european parliament and then re presented in their original form some national governments seem to be aware of the problems poland has rejected the proposal and germany s main political parties have opposed it but there is not enough opposition to guarantee their rejection early in december the british government held a consultation meeting with those who had commented on the proposals science minister lord sainsbury went along to listen and outline the uk position but according to those present it was embarrassing to see how little the minister and his officials actually understood the issues concerned the draft directive is being put through the council as what is called an a item and can only be approved or rejected no discussion or amendment is allowed so why should we be worried first there is the abuse of the democratic process involved in disregarding the views of the parliament and abandoning all of their carefully argued amendments this goes to the heart of the european project and even those who do not care about software or patents should be worried if coders are treated like this today who is to say that it will not be you tomorrow more directly once software patents are granted then any programmer will have to worry that the code they are writing is infringing someone else s patent this is not about stealing software as code is already protected by copyright patents are not copyright but something much stronger a patent gives the owner the right to stop anyone else using their invention even if the other person invented it separately i have never to my shame managed to read lord byron s childe harold s pilgrimage if it was pointed out that one of my articles contained a substantial chunk of the poem then i could defend myself in court by claiming that i had simply made it up and it was coincidence the same does not hold for a patent if i sit down this afternoon and write a brilliant graphics compression routine and it happens to be the same as the lzw algorithm used in gif files then i am in trouble under patent law at least in the us coincidence is no defence the proposed directive is supported by many of the major software companies but this is hardly surprising since most of them are us based and they have already had to cope with a legal environment that allows patents they have legal departments and more crucially patents of their own which they can trade or cross license with other patent holders even this system breaks down of course as microsoft found out last year when they initially lost a case brought by eolas which claimed that internet explorer and other browsers infringed an eolas patent that one was eventually thrown out but only after months of uncertainty and millions of dollars but small companies and the free and open software movement do not have any patents to trade much of the really useful software we use every day programs like the apache web server the gnu linux operating system and the fearsomely popular firefox browser is developed outside company structures by people who do not have legal departments to check for patent infringements the damage to software will not happen overnight of course if the directive goes through it has to be written into national laws and then there will be a steady stream of legal actions against small companies and open source products eventually someone will decide to attack linux directly probably with some secret funding from one or two large players the new directive will limit innovation by forcing programmers to spend time checking for patent infringements or simply avoiding working in potentially competitive areas and it will damage europe s computer industry we can only hope that the council of ministers has the integrity and strength to reject this bad law bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital

1,s korea spending boost to economy south korea will boost state spending next year in an effort to create jobs and kick start its sputtering economy it has earmarked 100 trillion won 96bn for the first six months of 2005 60 of its total annual budget the government s main problems are slumping consumption and a contraction in the construction industry it aims to create 400 000 jobs and will focus on infrastructure and home building as well as providing public firms with money to hire new workers the government has set an economic growth rate target of 5 for next year and hinted that would be in danger unless it took action internal and external economic conditions are likely to remain unfavourable in 2005 the finance and economy ministry said in a statement it blamed continuing uncertainties such as fluctuating oil prices and foreign exchange rates and stagnant domestic demand that has shown few signs of a quick rebound in 2004 growth will be between 4 7 and 4 8 the ministry said not everyone is convinced the plan will work our primary worry centres on the what we believe is the government s overly optimistic view that its front loading of the budget will be enough to turn the economy around consultancy 4cast said in a report the problem facing south korea is that many consumers are reeling from the effects of a credit bubble that only recently burst millions of south koreans are defaulting on their credit card bills and the country s biggest card lender has been hovering on the verge of bankruptcy for months as part of its spending plans the government said it will ask firms to roll over mortgage loans that come due in the first half of 2005 it also pledged to look at ways of helping families on low incomes the government voiced concern about the effect of redundancies in the building trade given the economic spill over and employment effect in the construction sector a sharp downturn in the construction industry could have other adverse effects the ministry said as a result south korea will give private companies also will be given the chance to build schools hospitals houses and other public buildings it also will look at real estate tax system other plans on the table include promoting new industries such as bio technology and nano technology as well as offering increased support to small and medium sized businesses the focus will be on job creation and economic recovery given that unfavourable domestic and global conditions are likely to dog the korean economy in 2005 the ministry said
0,how to make a gigapixel picture the largest digital panoramic photo in the world has been created by researchers in the netherlands the finished image is 2 5 billion pixels in size making it about 500 times the resolution of images produced by good consumer digital cameras the huge image of delft was created by stitching together 600 single snaps of the dutch city taken at a fixed spot if printed out in standard 300 dots per inch resolution the picture would be 2 5m high and 6m long the researchers have put the image on a website which lets viewers explore the wealth of detail that it captures tools on the page let viewers zoom in on the city and its surroundings in great detail the website is already proving popular and currently has more than 200 000 visitors every day the image was created by imaging experts from the dutch research and technology laboratory tno which created the 2 5 gigapixel photo as a summer time challenge the goal of the project was to be one of the first groups to make gigapixel images the first image of such a size was manually constructed by us photographer max lyons in november 2003 that image portrayed bryce canyon national park in utah and was made up of 196 separate photographs the panorama of delft is a little staid in contrast to the dramatic rockscape captured in mr lyons image he did it all by hand which was an enormous effort and we got the idea that if you use automatic techniques it would be feasible to build a larger image said jurgen den hartog one of the tno researchers behind the project we were not competing with mr lyons but it started as a lunchtime bet the dutch team used already available technologies although it had to upgrade them to be able to handle the high resolution image we had to rewrite almost all the tools me den hartog told the bbc news website all standard windows viewers available would not be able to load such a large image so we had to develop one ourselves the 600 component pictures were taken on july 2004 by a computer controlled camera with a 400 mm lens each image was made to slightly overlap so they could be accurately arranged into a composite the stitching process was also done automatically using five powerful pcs over three days following the success of this project and with promises of help from others the tno team is considering creating a full 360 degree panoramic view of another dutch city with even higher resolution
3,dvd review harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban this third harry potter film brought a change of director and a dramatic visual shake up that really shines on dvd gone are the warm bright colours found in the two earlier films alfonso cuaron brings in a bleak and cold feel that is simply gorgeous and looks even better here than in the cinema it is all part of the progression of harry s story into darker areas but you ll spend time just marvelling at the beautiful hogwarts landscape this is the first potter film where you get so lost in the screen adaptation that you forget the book it is the third year at hogwarts and studies are interrupted as they always are by a calamity that only harry ron and hermione can put right it sounds corny but harry is no longer the winsome hero he is a moody teenager and daniel radcliffe pulls it off very well emma watson is ever better as hermione and the young stars are joined by the usual myriad famous actors including gary oldman and emma thompson the film itself is the reason to buy this dvd but it is laden with behind the scenes extras including funny if shallow interviews with all the main cast but what seems like a long list of features can be swiftly whittled down to the few that you are going to watch younger viewers will go for the games which include a magic you may have missed memory test and crookshanks chasing off after scabbers adult viewers will ignore those and go straight to the deleted scenes you will understand why they were deleted but it is fun to see more footage and not have to hunt through endless menus to find it as we did on the first harry potter dvd the most interesting pieces are an interview with jk rowling in creating the vision and conjuring a scene a short featurette about the making of the film s big moments

4,woolf murder sentence rethink plans to give murderers lighter sentences if they plead guilty have been watered down there was an outcry three months ago when the sentencing guidelines council led by lord woolf published its proposals for england and wales it had suggested judges should reduce sentences by a third for murderers who confessed at the earliest opportunity but that has now been changed to one sixth with no reduction for those killers given a whole life tariff at the time lord woolf the lord chief justice had said the one third reduction would only be in extraordinary circumstances for example if people gave themselves up before their crime had even been detected the guidelines were to recognise the need to spare victims and witnesses the trauma of going to court where possible by allowing lighter sentences for guilty pleas and co operation he said but director of the victims of crime trust norman brennan accused lord woolf of having an arrogant contempt for victims of crime and the law abiding public the national association of probation officers said the move would be political suicide in revised proposals from the sentencing guidelines council sgc the section on murder said possible reductions would have to be weighed carefully by a judge so they did not lead to an inappropriately short sentence where it was appropriate to reduce the minimum term having regard to a plea of guilty the maximum reduction would be one sixth and should never exceed five years it said in a statement issued on wednesday lord woolf said i have no doubt that being able to call on the diverse backgrounds and experiences of all those that serve on the sgc has vastly improved the final guidelines i am confident as a result that judges will be better placed to deliver sentences which are effective both as punishments and deterrents to offending and reoffending director of public prosecutions ken macdonald qc who sits on the sgc said the principle of discounting sentences to offenders for early guilty pleas is set down by parliament what the new guideline on reduced sentences for guilty pleas does is increase the chances of convicting the guilty by bringing clarity to this process it represents a tougher regime than existed previously because the discount is automatically reduced if a guilty plea is not made at the first available opportunity he said

4,lords wrong on detainees straw jack straw has attacked the decision by britain s highest court that detaining foreign terrorist suspects without trial breaks human rights laws the foreign secretary said the right to life was the most important liberty and the government had a duty to protect people from terrorism law lords were simply wrong to imply the men were being held arbitrarily new home secretary charles clarke vowed the nine men would remain in prison while the law was being reviewed the house of lords ruled by an eight to one majority in favour of appeals by the men dealing a major blow to the government s anti terror policy but mr straw denied it amounted to a constitutional crisis he said those held had a right of appeal to the special immigration appeal tribunal and the decision to hold the suspects was upheld by that court the law lords are simply wrong to imply that this is a decision to detain these people on the whim or the certificate of the home secretary he told bbc radio 4 s today programme the foreign secretary insisted it was for parliament and not judges to decide how best britain could be defended against the threat of terrorism but liberal democrat peer lord carlile the government s independent reviewer of anti terrorism laws said it was possible some of the detainees could now be released he said the law lords ruling was an embarrassment for the government and major changes were needed to the law the ruling came on charles clarke s first day as home secretary following david blunkett s resignation in a statement to mps mr clarke said i will be asking parliament to renew this legislation in the new year in the meantime we will be studying the judgment carefully to see whether it is possible to modify our legislation to address the concerns raised by the house of lords the detainees took their case to the house of lords after the court of appeal backed the home office s powers to hold them without limit or charge the government opted out of part of the european convention on human rights concerning the right to a fair trial in order to bring in anti terrorism legislation in response to the 11 september attacks in the us any foreign national suspected of links with terrorism can be detained or can opt to be deported but those detained cannot be deported if this would mean persecution in their homeland on thursday lord bingham a senior law lord said the rules were incompatible with the european convention on human rights as they allowed detentions in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status by justifying detention without trial for foreign suspects but not britons lord nicholls of birkenhead in his ruling said indefinite imprisonment without charge or trial is anathema in any country which observes the rule of law in a statement detainee a in woodhill prison said i hope now that the government will act upon this decision scrap this illegal law and release me and the other internees to return to our families and loved ones the case was heard by a panel of nine law lords rather than the usual five because of the constitutional importance of the case solicitor gareth pierce who represents eight of the detainees claimed the detention had driven four of the detainees to madness saying two were being held in broadmoor hospital

2,newcastle 2 1 bolton kieron dyer smashed home the winner to end bolton s 10 game unbeaten run lee bowyer put newcastle ahead when he fed stephen carr on the right flank then sprinted into the area to power home a header from the resultant cross wanderers hit back through stelios giannakopoulos who ended a fluid passing move with a well struck volley but dyer had the last word in a game of few chances pouncing on a loose ball after alan shearer s shot was blocked and firing into the top corner neither side lacked urgency in the early stages of the game with plenty of tackles flying in but opportunities in front of goal were harder to come by bolton keeper jussi jaaskelainen had to make two saves in quick succession midway through the first half keeping out shearer s low shot and dyer s close range header but that was the only goalmouth action of note and it was almost out of nothing that the magpies took the lead on 35 minutes bowyer found space with a neat turn on the half way line and striding forward picked out carr to his right he then continued his run and with perfect timing made his way into the box where he met carr s cross with a downward header into the far corner bolton had produced little going forward at this point but they responded well they were level within six minutes thanks to a smart finish from giannakopoulos jay jay okocha twisted and turned on the edge of the area and after a neat exchange of passes involving kevin davies and gary speed the greek striker found the bottom corner with a first time strike the magpies were opened up again before half time as davies set giannakopoulos in space and given had to block at his near post but the home side survived and they should have re taken the lead with the first meaningful attack of the second half fernando hierro cynically chopped down dyer on the edge of the area with the midfielder clean through but the veteran defender escaped with a booking as there were other defenders nearby and from the resultant free kick laurent robert curled the ball just wide bolton were creating little going forward and they seemed content to frustrate the magpies their strategy seemed to be working until the 69th minute alan shearer s snap shot was charged down and dyer reacted first to smash the ball past the despairing jaaskelainen from six yards bolton boss sam allardyce i am bitterly disappointed with the result but i am probably more disappointed with the second half performance in the first half we had put them under a lot of pressure and our goal matched theirs in quality i thought it would lift us and that they might be tired after playing a lot of games but unfortunately we were not up for the battle in the second half we allowed them to heap too much pressure on us and in the end we cracked newcastle boss graeme souness we deserved the win we had a really good second half bolton are a difficult side to play you have to match them physically first but we did that and then we played some football we had a slow first 45 minutes when we looked a bit tired but we got going after that the scoreline flattered them and we could have had one or two more goals newcastle given carr boumsong bramble babayaro dyer faye bowyer robert jenas 77 ameobi shearer subs not used butt harper milner hughes goals bowyer 35 dyer 69 bolton jaaskelainen hunt fadiga 14 n gotty ben haim candela giannakopoulos okocha vaz te 77 hierro campo 64 speed gardner davies subs not used jaidi poole booked ben haim hierro goals giannakopoulos 41 att 50 430 ref s dunn gloucestershire

3,bbc should allow more scrutiny mps have urged the bbc to give watchdogs more freedom to scrutinise how 2bn in licence fee money is spent the public accounts committee called for the national audit office to be given a free hand to investigate how the bbc offers value for money although six areas are to be opened up to scrutiny the audit office should have more power to choose what it investigated the mps said the call was made in a report into the bbc s freeview digital service our aim is not to rewrite the storyline of eastenders but simply to ensure that the bbc is as accountable to parliament as any other organisation spending public money said the committee chairman mp edward leigh the bbc s spending is not subject to the full independent scrutiny and accountability to parliament parliament requires television owners to pay a licence fee and expects the comptroller and auditor general on behalf of parliament to be able to scrutinise how that money over 2 billion a year is used a bbc spokeswoman said we share the committee s interest in ensuring the public money we receive is spent well though in its infancy we think the arrangements with the nao are working well and should be given time to mature the report said the freeview digital service has had an impressive take up since its launch but the bbc must still dispel confusion about the service the committee found the bbc had succeeded in ensuring subscription free access to digital channels following the collapse of itv digital in 2002 but the fact that one in four homes could not access freeview remained a problem the report said that while gaps in the coverage were largely due to landscape issues there was need for detailed explanations on the freeview website and on promotional literature as to why it was not available in specific areas the government has proposed switch off of the analogue television signal with 2012 the most recently proposed date the bbc launched freeview in 2002 as an alternative to satellite subscription services such as sky to allow its digital channels such as bbc three and news 24 to be seen there have been an estimated five million freeview set top boxes sold since the launch and prices have fallen considerably the corporation plans to spend up to 138m on freeview before 2014 to ensure people can receive the service throughout the uk and are aware of it

0,lifestyle governs mobile choice faster better or funkier hardware alone is not going to help phone firms sell more handsets research suggests instead phone firms keen to get more out of their customers should not just be pushing the technology for its own sake consumers are far more interested in how handsets fit in with their lifestyle than they are in screen size onboard memory or the chip inside shows an in depth study by telecommunications company ericsson historically in the industry there has been too much focus on using technology said dr michael bjorn senior advisor on mobile media at ericsson s consumer and enterprise lab we have to stop saying that these technologies will change their lives he said we should try to speak to consumers in their own language and help them see how it fits in with what they are doing he told the bbc news website for the study ericsson interviewed 14 000 mobile phone owners on the ways they use their phone people s habits remain the same said dr bjorn they just move the activity into the mobile phone as it s a much more convenient way to do it one good example of this was diary writing among younger people he said while diaries have always been popular a mobile phone especially one equipped with a camera helps them keep it in a different form youngsters use of text messages also reflects their desire to chat and keep in contact with friends and again just lets them do it in a slightly changed way dr bjorn said that although consumers do what they always did but use a phone to do it the sheer variety of what the new handset technologies make possible does gradually drive new habits and lifestyles ericsson s research has shown that consumers divide into different tribes that use phones in different ways dr bjorn said groups dubbed pioneers and materialists were most interested in trying new things and were behind the start of many trends in phone use for instance he said older people are using sms much more than they did five years ago this was because younger users often the children of ageing mobile owners encouraged older people to try it so they could keep in touch another factor governing the speed of change in mobile phone use was the simple speed with which new devices are bought by pioneers and materialists only when about 25 of people have handsets with new innovations on them such as cameras can consumers stop worrying that if they send a picture message the person at the other end will be able to see it once this significant number of users is passed use of new innovations tends to take off dr bjorn said that early reports of camera phone usage in japan seemed to imply that the innovation was going to be a flop however he said now 45 of the japanese people ericsson questioned use their camera phone at least once a month in 2003 the figure was 29 similarly across europe the numbers of people taking snaps with cameras is starting to rise in 2003 only 4 of the people in the uk took a phonecam snap at least once a month now the figure is 14 similar rises have been seen in many other european nations dr bjorn said that people also used their camera phones in very different ways to film and even digital cameras usage patterns for digital cameras are almost exactly replacing usage patterns for analogue cameras he said digital cameras tend to be used on significant events such as weddings holidays and birthdays by contrast he said camera phones were being used much more to capture a moment and were being woven into everyday life

0,blogs take on the mainstream web logs or blogs are everywhere with at least an estimated five million on the web and that number is set to grow these online diaries come in many shapes and styles ranging from people willing to sharing their views pictures and links to companies interested in another way of reaching their customers but this year the focus has been on blogs which cast a critical eye over news events often writing about issues ignored by the big media or offering an eye witness account of events most blogs may have only a small readership but communication experts say they have provided an avenue for people to have a say in the world of politics the most well known examples include iraqi salam pax s accounts of the us led war former iranian vice president mohammad ali abtahi exclusive insight into the islamic republic s government and the highs and lows of the recent us election campaign there are already websites pulling together these first hand reporting accounts heralded by blogs like wikinews com launched last november the blogging movement has been building up for many years andrew nachison director of the media center a us based think tank that studies media technology and society highlights the us presidential race as a possible turning point for blogs you could look at that as a moment when audiences exercised a new form of power to choose among many more sources of information than they have never had before he says and blogs were a key part of that transformation among them were blogs carrying picture messages saying we are sorry for george w bush s victory and the responses from his supporters mr nachison argues blogs have become independent sources for images and ideas that circumvent traditional sources of news and information such as newspapers tv and radio we have to acknowledge that in all of these cases mainstream media actually plays a role in the discussion and the distribution of these ideas he told the bbc news website but they followed the story they didn t lead it some parts of the so called traditional media have expressed concerns about this emerging competitor raising questions about the journalistic value of blogs others like the french newspaper le monde have applied a different strategy offering blogs as part of its content i don t think the mission and role of journalism is threatened it is in transition as society itself is in transition says mr nachison however he agrees with other experts like the linguist and political analyst noam chomsky that mainstream media has lost the traditional role of news gatekeeper the one to many road of traditional journalism yes it is threatened and professional journalists need to acclimate themselves to an environment in which there are many more contributors to the discourse says mr nachison the notion of a gatekeeper who filters and decides what s acceptable for public consumption and what isn t that s gone forever with people now walking around with information devices in their pockets like camera or video phones we are going to see more instances of ordinary citizens breaking stories it seems unlikely that we will end up living in a planet where every human is a blogger but the current number of blogs is likely to keep on growing in a web already overloaded with information blog analysis firm technorati estimates the number of blogs in existence the so called blogosphere has already exceeded five million and is growing at exponential levels tools such as google s blogger movabletype and the recently launched beta version of msn spaces are making it easier to run a blog us research think tank pew internet american life says a blog is created every 5 8 seconds although less than 40 of the total are updated at least once every two months but experts agree that the phenomenon allowing individuals to publish share ideas exchange information comment on current issues post images or video on the web easily is here to stay we are entering one era in which the technological infrastructure is creating a different context for how we tell our stories and how we communicate with each other said mr nachison and there s going to be bad that comes with the good

0,learning to love broadband we are reaching the point where broadband is a central part of daily life at least for some argues technology analyst bill thompson one of the nice things about being a writer is that i rarely have to go to an office to work i can sit in a caf 233 or a library with or without a wi fi connection and research and write articles if i am passing through kings cross station on my way to a meeting then i can log on from the platform and i can spend the day working with my girlfriend anne a children s writer at her house in cambridge sharing her wireless network but just over a week ago i arrived at her house to find that there was no network connection we checked the cable modem and noticed that it had no power and when she changed the power lead it sparked at her in a way which made it abundantly clear that it was never going to talk to the internet again she called her service provider and they told her it would be five days before an engineer would show up with a new cable modem this did not seem too bad but in fact she really suffered until her connection was restored on wednesday with no modem installed in her computer she had to borrow internet access from friends or use the dial up connection on her daughter s laptop so she had to choose between copying her files onto her usb memory card or accepting a slower and flakier net connection as a result she did not submit the pictures she wanted to use for a book on earthquakes because they were too big to send over dial up she could not research other material because she is used to having easy access to a fast link that lets her search quickly and effectively but the impact spread into her personal life too she did not take her children to the cinema during half term because she could not find out which films were showing at the local cinemas she planned a trip to norfolk but did not check the weather because the only place she knows to look for weather information is the bbc website and she did not know where to go fossil hunting on the trip because she could not type fossils norfolk into google of course she readily admits she could have answered these questions if she had looked in the local paper listened to the radio or found a book on fossils but she did not because having fast always on and easy access to the net has become part of the routine of her daily life and when it was taken away it was too much effort to go back to the old ways of doing things she may be unusual but i do not think anne is alone according to ofcom there were almost four million broadband users in the uk in april 2004 and numbers are climbing fast there will certainly be five million by the end of the year dial up users are switching to broadband my dad finally made the change earlier this month and new net users are selecting broadband from the start more and more of these broadband users are beginning to mould their daily lives around the availability of broadband internet connections and they too will find it difficult to cope if they cannot get online for any reason it is part of the process of adaptation and it is a vital step in the growth of broadband in the uk and elsewhere people who have integrated net access into their daily lives tell their friends about it and show off the cool stuff they can do they encourage other people to get broadband so that they can share digital photos and do all of the other things that need fast and reliable connectivity of course broadband in the uk is laughably slow compared to other parts of the world in south korea japan and hong kong normal connection speeds are measured in megabits or millions of bits a second rather than the thousands that we are supposed to be happy with but speed is only a small part of the attraction of broadband and when it comes to checking websites for film times looking at weather forecasts or all of the other small things that make a real difference to the routines and habits of our daily lives even uk speeds are sufficient it may not be the brave new world of streaming full screen video and superfast file downloads but it will do for now and it is certainly better than slow access or no access just ask anne bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital
4,campaign cold calls questioned labour and the conservatives are still telephoning the millions of people who have signed up to make sure they do not get marketing cold calls the parties say they can stick to the rules by ensuring that their calls are not marketing for instance by asking about people s voting intentions the lib dems are asking the watchdog overseeing the rules to stop the calls the information commissioner s office says surveys are allowed but people had to be told if personal data was kept telephone call centres are expected to be used as never before by all the three major parties in the run up to the general election but seven million telephone numbers are on the telephone preference service tps lists which ban unsolicited sales and marketing calls both schemes are run by the direct marketing association and backed by eu directives on privacy and electronic communications the rules on marketing calls apply as much to politicians as to private sector companies but that does not mean labour and the tories are not calling people signed up to the tps a labour party spokesman told the bbc news website the party avoided those on tps lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising but that did not happen for voter identification calls when we ask which party they will vote for that is not marketing and we have very clear legal advice that it is not he said so it is not covered by the telephone preference service he said the party always asked people if they would be happy to be contacted again and if they said no they were not rung again a conservative spokeswoman said the party stuck to the rules when it rang tps subscribers she said we do apply tps but in line with the law we would not do things that are not allowed in the law assistant information commissioner phil jones said it was classed as marketing if political parties telephoned people to encourage them to vote for them but classic market research such as a poll of voter intentions did not constitute direct marketing he said if a party is calling someone who is registered on tps and records their voting intention with a view to using this information in the future this should be clear to the voter concerned said mr jones if a party rings a person who is registered on tps to ask about their voting intention and goes on to encourage that voter to support them the party may well be in breach of the regulations in summary whether a party calling tps registered voters to check their voting intentions will breach regulations will depend on the script used and whether the script is followed mr jones said the watchdog received very few complaints on the issue earlier lib dem chairman matthew taylor wrote to the watchdog saying the advice we have received on several previous occasions is that such phone calls are illegal he says evidence from local lib dem parties around the country suggests there are significant numbers of such calls i hope you can therefore take swift and efficient action to ensure that this ceases he tells the commissioner mr taylor argues there should be new guidelines so all parties can act in the same way if the watchdog believes the rules allow parties to ring tps numbers about voting intentions and later urge those people to vote for them

1,us to rule on yukos refuge call yukos has said a us bankruptcy court will decide whether to block russia s impending auction of its main production arm on thursday the russian oil firm has filed for bankruptcy protection in the us in an attempt to halt the forced sale however judge letitia clark said the hearing would continue on thursday when arguments in the case would be heard russian authorities are due to auction off yuganskneftegas on 19 december to pay a huge tax bill sent to yukos russian prosecutors are forcing the sale of the firm s most lucrative asset yuganskneftegas to help pay a 27bn 14bn back tax bill which they claim is owed by yukos filing for bankruptcy protection in the us was a last resort to preserve the rights of our shareholders employees and customers said yukos chief executive steven theede the company added it had opted to take action through american courts as us bankruptcy law gives worldwide jurisdiction over a debtor company s property and because it was seeking a judiciary willing to protect the value of shareholders investments however as the firm is based in russia and has no significant us assets lawyers are unsure of the outcome of the case we are here to stop 60 of our body from being cut off on sunday zack clement a lawyer for yukos told judge clark in an emergency hearing in houston texas on wednesday as well as the bid to get chapter 11 bankruptcy which protects firms from creditors allowing them to continue trading as they restructure their finances the group also made a claim for damages against the russian government yukos asked the houston court to order russia to arbitration so that it can press claims for billions of dollars in damages over a campaign of illegal discriminatory and disproportionate tax claims mr clement said that under russian law the russian government was obliged to enter into arbitration as set out in international law he added that the opening bid for the firm s yuganskneftgas unit was 8bn less than half of the 20bn that yukos advisers say it is worth we believe the only significant bidder at the auction on sunday is gazprom he said referring to russia s natural gas giant yukos maintains that the forced auction is illegal and will cause the company to suffer immediate and irreparable harm many commentators believe the russian government s aggressive pursuit of yukos is a politically motivated response to the political ambitions of its former chief executive mikhail khodorkovsky mr khodorkovsky who had funded liberal opposition groups was arrested in october last year on fraud and tax evasion charges and is still in jail analysts believe that if its production unit is auctioned off it is likely to be bought up by a government backed firm like gazprom effectively bringing a large chunk of russia s lucrative oil and gas industry back under state control

4,brown and blair face new rift claims for the umpteenth time tony blair and gordon brown are said to have declared all out war on each other this time the alleged rift is over who should take the credit for the government s global aid and debt initiatives particularly in the wake of the tsunami disaster an issue many hoped and believed was above such things it dominated the prime minister s monthly news conference which saw mr blair start in full irritation mode as he was forced to bat away question after question about his relationship with his neighbour as he told journalists i am not interested in what goes in and out of newspapers there is a complete unity of purpose and he again heaped praise on mr brown saying he was doing a great job and would continue doing it although he would not commit to any job for mr brown after the election so why did he arrange his press conference at the last moment so it coincided with mr brown s long arranged keynote speech on aid and debt he was asked by now mr blair had moved from irritation mode to his barely disguised fury setting he snapped back that the hacks knew very well what the operational reasons were for the timing of his press conference well not really as it happens and he repeated what a great man gordon was and how united they were before again sneering that he took absolutely no notice of what went in and out of the newspapers preferring to get on with the job of doing the best for the country and the world although in the next breath he declared i get increasingly alarmed by what i read in the newspapers before catching himself on and quickly adding in so far as i read them of course he probably had good reason to be alarmed because the newspapers had been full of stories about the claimed open warfare between the two men as far as the timing of the prime minister s press conference is concerned there are two options the first is that it was a calculated attempt to upstage the chancellor and seize back the initiative on the big issue of the moment if that is the case it suggests that even the fear of seriously negative newspaper headlines is not enough to stop the squabbling the second option is that it was an unavoidable coincidence which would suggest the government has lost its once famed ability to strictly co ordinate announcements through the infamous downing street grid to avert just such allegations either way the effect was the same to overshadow the big announcements of government policy on a hugely pertinent issue and there had been previous suggestions that the new year had started with a fresh outbreak of the warfare between the two men firstly the prime minister insisted on wednesday that he had been intimately involved in the development of the proposals to get g8 countries to freeze debt repayments from the tsunami hit countries it was claimed he had been embarrassed by the fact that gordon brown appeared to have taken the initiative over the government s response to the disaster while mr blair was still on holiday in egypt then as if to pour fuel on the flames both men separately spoke about working on tsunami or wider aid and development policy with their cabinet colleagues foreign secretary jack straw aid minister hilary benn and deputy prime minister john prescott without mentioning the other all this came amid fresh claims that mr brown was still seething that he had been excluded from a prominent role in general election planning and had as a result started to set out his own platform the fact that he used an article in the guardian newspaper to set out what he believed should be in the manifesto has embarked on a mini tour of britain to set out his aid plans and will next week visit africa on the same mission often seen as the prime minister s turf has only added to the impression of rival camps operating entirely independently of each other the prime minister denied all that as well repeating his insistence that it was inconceivable the economy and the chancellor would not be at the centre of the election campaign but the big fear with many on the labour benches now is that unless a lid can be put on the speculation over the rivalry it may even threaten to undermine the election campaign itself
4,police chief backs drinking move a chief constable has backed the introduction of 24 drinking saying police had a responsibility to ensure people could benefit from a law change however norfolk police chief andy hayman also warned that a great deal of preparatory work was still needed i don t subscribe to the views of some of my colleagues who are coming out and objecting to it he said his comments come after the liberal democrats backed tory demands that the government s plans be put on hold andy hayman said he did not agree with politicians and senior police officers who have objected to the plans which come into force on 7 february i feel that is a premature position to be taking he said among those who have criticised the plans are the uk s top policeman sir john stevens the metropolitan police chief said last week that the plans for 24 hour drinking should be re examined because of a binge drinking epidemic however mr hayman said it would be totally unacceptable in my view for a chief constable to say i m very sorry he said that police should make sure that responsible people who wanted a change could benefit from more liberal legislation my view is that i have got a responsibility to create an environment where that can happen he said however he believes a lot of preparatory work is still needed to be done by police local authorities and the drinks industry before the nation was ready for 24 hour drinking but he is confident problems in the early days can be ironed out he believed the majority of people favoured this law change and we have to accept that lifestyles are changing but aspects such as transport and basic things such as making sure public toilets are open all night had to be taken into account prime minister tony blair has defended the licensing act saying it is wrong to deny people the relaxed hours enjoyed elsewhere in europe because of a tiny minority of violent binge drinkers a six month transitional period starts on 7 february during which time venues can apply for extended licences the conservatives have called for 24 hour drinking to be shelved until the problems of binge drinking are solved on monday the lib dems also called for a delay lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten said it would clearly be prudent to allow the police and local authorities more time to prepare for flexible drinking hours chief constable mr hayman acknowledged that binge drinking did cause problems if you come to norwich on a friday or saturday night you will see things going on that will you make you feel ashamed however i want industry to succeed in norwich and i want norwich to be the recognised nightspot of east anglia there is no way i want to say we cannot manage it or police it we can

0,tv future in the hands of viewers with home theatre systems plasma high definition tvs and digital video recorders moving into the living room the way people watch tv will be radically different in five years time that is according to an expert panel which gathered at the annual consumer electronics show in las vegas to discuss how these new technologies will impact one of our favourite pastimes with the us leading the trend programmes and other content will be delivered to viewers via home networks through cable satellite telecoms companies and broadband service providers to front rooms and portable devices one of the most talked about technologies of ces has been digital and personal video recorders dvr and pvr these set top boxes like the us s tivo and the uk s sky system allow people to record store play pause and forward wind tv programmes when they want essentially the technology allows for much more personalised tv they are also being built in to high definition tv sets which are big business in japan and the us but slower to take off in europe because of the lack of high definition programming not only can people forward wind through adverts they can also forget about abiding by network and channel schedules putting together their own a la carte entertainment but some us networks and cable and satellite companies are worried about what it means for them in terms of advertising revenues as well as brand identity and viewer loyalty to channels although the us leads in this technology at the moment it is also a concern that is being raised in europe particularly with the growing uptake of services like sky what happens here today we will see in nine months to a years time in the uk adam hume the bbc broadcast s futurologist told the bbc news website for the likes of the bbc there are no issues of lost advertising revenue yet it is a more pressing issue at the moment for commercial uk broadcasters but brand loyalty is important for everyone we will be talking more about content brands rather than network brands said tim hanlon from brand communications firm starcom mediavest the reality is that with broadband connections anybody can be the producer of content he added the challenge now is that it is hard to promote a programme with so much choice what this means said stacey jolna senior vice president of tv guide tv group is that the way people find the content they want to watch has to be simplified for tv viewers it means that networks in us terms or channels could take a leaf out of google s book and be the search engine of the future instead of the scheduler to help people find what they want to watch this kind of channel model might work for the younger ipod generation which is used to taking control of their gadgets and what they play on them but it might not suit everyone the panel recognised older generations are more comfortable with familiar schedules and channel brands because they know what they are getting they perhaps do not want so much of the choice put into their hands mr hanlon suggested on the other end you have the kids just out of diapers who are pushing buttons already everything is possible and available to them said mr hanlon ultimately the consumer will tell the market they want of the 50 000 new gadgets and technologies being showcased at ces many of them are about enhancing the tv watching experience high definition tv sets are everywhere and many new models of lcd liquid crystal display tvs have been launched with dvr capability built into them instead of being external boxes one such example launched at the show is humax s 26 inch lcd tv with an 80 hour tivo dvr and dvd recorder one of the us s biggest satellite tv companies directtv has even launched its own branded dvr at the show with 100 hours of recording capability instant replay and a search function the set can pause and rewind tv for up to 90 hours and microsoft chief bill gates announced in his pre show keynote speech a partnership with tivo called tivotogo which means people can play recorded programmes on windows pcs and mobile devices all these reflect the increasing trend of freeing up multimedia so that people can watch what they want when they want

0,bond game fails to shake or stir for gaming fans the word goldeneye evokes excited memories not only of the james bond revival flick of 1995 but also the classic shoot em up that accompanied it and left n64 owners glued to their consoles for many an hour adopting that hallowed title somewhat backfires on this new game for it fails to deliver on the promise of its name and struggles to generate the original s massive sense of fun this however is not a sequel nor does it relate to the goldeneye film you are the eponymous renegade spy an agent who deserts to the bond world s extensive ranks of criminal masterminds after being deemed too brutal for mi6 your new commander in chief is the portly auric goldfinger last seen in 1964 but happily running around bent on world domination with a determination to justify its name which is even less convincing than that of tina turner s similarly titled theme song the game literally gives the player a golden eye following an injury which enables a degree of x ray vision rogue agent signals its intentions by featuring james bond initially and proceeding to kill him off within moments squashed by a plummeting helicopter the notion is of course to add a novel dark edge to a 007 game but the premise simply does not get the juices flowing like it needs to recent bond games like nightfire and everything or nothing were very competent and did a fine job of capturing the sense of flair invention and glamour of the film franchise this title lacks that aura and when the bond magic shines through it feels like a lucky accident the central problem is that the gameplay just is not good enough quite aside from the bizarre inability to jump the even more bizarre glaring graphical bugs and dubious enemy ai the levels simply are not put together with much style or imagination admittedly the competition has been tough even in recent weeks with the likes of halo 2 and half life 2 triumphing in virtually every department what the game is good at is enveloping you in noisy dynamic scenes of violent chaos as is the trend of late you are made to feel like you are in the midst of a really messy and fraught encounter sadly that sense of action is outweighed by the difficulty of navigating and battling within the chaos meaning that frustration is often the outcome and irregular save points mean you have to backtrack each time you are killed a minute red dot passes for a crosshair although the collision detection is so suspect that the difficulties of aiming weapons are compensated for shooting enemies from a distance can be tricky and you will not always know you have picked them off since dead enemies vanish literally before they have fully hit the floor and they do so in some woefully uninspiring death animations it is perhaps indicative of a lack of confidence that the game maker s allow you several different weapons almost immediately and throw you quickly into raging firefights no time is risked with a measured build up by far the most satisfying element of the game is seeing old favourites like dr no goldfinger hat fiend oddjob and crazed russian sex beast xenia onatopp resurrected after all these years and with their faces rendered in an impressively recognisable fashion there is a real thrill from doing battle with these legendary villains and it is a testament to the power of the bond universe that they can cut such a dash but the in game niggles combined with a story and presentation that just do not feel sufficiently well thought through will make this a disappointment for most diehard fans of bond will probably find enough here to make it a worthwhile purchase and try to ignore the failings the game is weak not completely unplayable then again 007 fanatics may also take umbrage at the cavalier blending of characters from different eras given james bond s healthy pedigree in past games there is every reason to hope that this is just a blip a commendable idea that just has not worked that will be rectified when the character inevitably makes his return goldeneye rogue agent is out now

2,murphy that was a bruising battle that s what i call a tough game it was very physical and fair play to the italians they made us work very hard for our victory their organisation was very very good and they proved again that they are getting better and better as the years go by it is by far the strongest italian team that we have faced we knew all along that we would be a huge threat particularly the first game in the championship it was not like the days gone by when you could get scores on the board early we had to work our socks off and try and build our scores gradually it was really hard work out there and the players have plenty of bumps and bruises to prove it i m not too bad but there are one or two others who will be feeling it a bit on monday morning in the backs we were not frustrated at such but the new rucking laws were a little bit problematical the different interpretations between the referee and the players was a little difficult but we managed to get the ball in our hands and i got a try near the end of the first half it s always good to score it was great work by brian and i always knew i had scored even though it went upstairs to the video referee eddie o sullivan was very calm at half time even though we were only 8 6 ahead he spelled out what we needed to do and advocated getting the ball out of our own territory that new ruck law made it a bit more difficult to get out of our own half we were penalised a lot at the breakdown and if they had kicked all their chances at goal we would have been behind at the break so really we went back to playing a territory game and simplifying things and having more patience on the ball every one was a little down after the game following the injuries to brian and gordon as yet we do not know the full extent of the injuries but it does not that good now we have to focus on scotland and only six days to recover it s a big ask after such a bruising encounter i was very impressed the way the scots played against the french on saturday it could so easily have gone their way but for a couple of decisions we will be under no illusions it is going to be tough for us in the meantime when in rome

0,blinx sequel purrs nicely the original blinx was intended to convert many platform game lovers to microsoft s then new xbox console its sharp graphics and novel gameplay with the main character able to pause slow rewind and fast forward time were meant to lure many fans to the new machine but poor design meant the game became a very frustrating affair with players often stranded half way through a level without the required tools to finish thankfully the sequel has fixed many of the original faults this time around you do not play as blinx but instead you are given the chance to create two unique cat characters and two pig characters the character generator is very detailed and a few minutes of tweaking and adjusting will create a unique personality to unleash on the game as the game progresses you swap between the two rival factions pig and feline assuming the role of your created characters the thrust of the game sees the two factions competing to recover pieces of a missing time crystal as in the original your feline persona can control time but this time the pigs get to control space there are a number of puzzles which require control over time to solve while the pigs can create things such as warps space bubbles and void traps in order to progress the control over space and time is achieved through a number of vcr style icons and is quite intuitive annoyingly the puzzles are a little too obviously flagged up and most gamers will find it more of a chore than a challenge to solve them the game has also tried to emulate franchises such as jak and daxter and ratchet and clank on ps2 and so there are a number of combat elements these are a little predictable and tend to drag the general polish of the game down to a more dulled affair but the game s excellent graphics easily the best looking platform game around sound and dollops of humour make it an attractive game for younger platform fans blinx 2 is out on xbox now
0,blind student hears in colour a blind student has developed software that turns colours into musical notes so that he can read weather maps victor wong a graduate student from hong kong studying at cornell university in new york state had to read coloured maps of the upper atmosphere as part of his research to study space weather mr wong needed to explore minute fluctuations in order to create mathematical models a number of solutions were tried including having a colleague describe the maps and attempting to print them in braille mr wong eventually hit upon the idea of translating individual colours into music and enlisted the help of a computer graphics specialist and another student to do the programming work the images have three dimensions and i had to find a way of reading them myself mr wong told the bbc news website for the sake of my own study and for the sake of blind scientists generally i felt it would be good to develop software that could help us to read colour images he tried a prototype version of the software to explore a photograph of a parrot in order to have an exact reference to the screen a pen and tablet device is used the software then assigns one of 88 piano notes to individually coloured pixels ranging from blue at the lower end of this scale to red at the upper end mr wong says the application is still very much in its infancy and is only useful for reading images that have been created digitally if i took a random picture and scanned it and then used my software to recognise it it wouldn t work that well mr wong has been blind from the age of seven and he thinks that having a colour memory makes the software more useful than it would be to a scientist who had never had any vision as the notes increase in pitch i know the colour s getting redder and redder and in my mind s eye a patch of red appears the colour to music software has not yet been made available commercially and mr wong believes that several people would have to work together to make it viable but he hopes that one day it can be developed to give blind people access to photographs and other images

4,scots smoking ban details set out smoke free areas will save lives and improve scotland s health first minister jack mcconnell has insisted he told the scottish parliament on wednesday that a comprehensive ban on smoking in public places would be introduced by the spring of 2006 mr mcconnell said the country s health rates were lamentable not least because of smoking he said fines of up to 2 500 would be levied on employers and licences would be removed for non compliance earlier the scottish executive considered a range of options but agreed unanimously to introduce an all out ban on smoking in public places in a statement to parliament mr mcconnell said that the licensed trade would be asked to join an expert committee prior to the ban coming into force the health arguments far outweighed lingering public disquiet about a complete ban and claims by the licensed trade that jobs would be lost he told msps he said there would be an international marketing campaign whereby tourists can enjoy smoke free environment and the sick man of europe image becomes a thing of the past there are still national habits which hold us back the time has come for this parliament to accelerate improvements in health he declared health rates are lamentable because of a lack of exercise drugs abuse excessive drinking and over eating they all make us one of the most unhealthy countries in europe and too many smoke it is clear that scotland must not be held back by poor public health the single biggest contribution devolved government can make is to reduce the toll of preventable death caused by smoking the legislation will be introduced as part of the health service miscellaneous provisions bill which will be considered by parliament before christmas main points of the plan a comprehensive ban on smoking in all enclosed public places in scotland the legislation will be enforced by environmental health and local licensing officers licensees or employers who fail to enforce the law will face fines up to a maximum of 2 500 licensees who persistently refuse to comply with the law will face the ultimate sanction of losing their liquor licence a system of issuing fixed penalty notices for those individuals who break the law will be examined individuals who persistently break the law will face a maximum fine of 1 000 mr mcconnell claimed there was evidence that smoking bans had helped smokers to either give up quicker or smoke less he said there had been falling cigarette sales of 13 in new york and 16 in ireland mr mcconnell added that there had been a near nine per cent rise in tax revenues from new york bars and restaurants and in ireland only a one point three per cent volume sales fall where they were declining before the ban the afternoon announcement following a cabinet meeting on wednesday morning won broad support from opposition parties the scottish national party s holyrood leader nicola sturgeon welcomed the move but added that the public should be consulted as the clock ticked towards the ban date she said the time has come for a ban on smoking in public places there is evidence a ban can cut deaths from passive smoking and makes it easier for the 70 of smokers who desperately want to give up the habit but we must also recognise that some people have concerns and reservations there are people who are yet to be persuaded the scottish conservative party leader david mcletchie questioned what would be exempted from the ban he was keen to know if inmates in scottish prisons would continue to be allowed to smoke mr mcletchie asked would it not be ironic and perhaps entirely typical of the first minister s brave new scotland that the criminals can be smokers but the smokers will become criminals the scottish green party s health spokeswoman eleanor scott said she was pleased scotland would be following the success stories of new york and ireland she believed the majority of people in scotland wanted to go out without having to breathe in harmful tobacco smoke

1,uk interest rates held at 4 75 the bank of england has left interest rates on hold again at 4 75 in a widely predicted move rates went up five times from november 2003 as the bank sought to cool the housing market and consumer debt but have remained unchanged since august recent data has indicated a slowdown in manufacturing and consumer spending as well as in mortgage approvals and retail sales disappointed over christmas with analysts putting the drop down to less consumer confidence rising interest rates and the accompanying slowdown in the housing market have knocked consumers optimism causing a sharp fall in demand for expensive goods according to a report earlier this week from the british retail consortium the brc said britain s retailers had endured their worst christmas in a decade today s no change decision is correct said david frost director general of the british chambers of commerce bcc but if there are clear signs that the economy slows the mpc should be ready to take quick corrective action and cut rates dismal reports from the retail trade about christmas sales are worrying if they indicate a more general weakening in consumer spending mr frost added the housing market outlook remains highly uncertain it is widely accepted that if house prices start falling more sharply the risks facing the economy will worsen considerably cbi chief economist ian mccafferty said the economy had slowed in recent months in response to rate rises but that it was difficult to gauge from the christmas period the likely pace of activity through the summer the bank is having to juggle the emergence of inflationary pressures driven by a tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices against the risk of an over abrupt slowdown in consumer activity he said interest rates are likely to remain on hold for some time on thursday there was more gloomy news on the manufacturing front as the office for national ons statistics revealed british manufacturing output unexpectedly fell in november for the fifth month in the past six the ons said manufacturing output dropped 0 1 in november matching a similar unrevised fall in october and confounding economists expectations of a 0 3 rise manufacturers organisation the eef said it expected the hold in interest rates to continue in the near future it also said there was evidence that manufacturers confidence may be waning as the outlook for the world economy becomes more uncertain so far the evidence suggests that last year s rate increases have helped to rebalance the economy without damaging the recovery in manufacturing said eef chief economist steve radley however should the business outlook start to deteriorate the bank should stand ready to cut rates some economists have predicted rates will drop later in the year although others feel the bank may still think there is a need for a rise to 5 before that happens the bank remains concerned about the long term risks posed by personal debt which is rising at 15 a year if economic conditions worsen

0,a decade of good website design the web looks very different today than it did 10 years ago back in 1994 yahoo had only just launched most websites were text based and amazon google and ebay had yet to appear but says usability guru dr jakob nielsen some things have stayed constant in that decade namely the principles of what makes a site easy to use dr nielsen has looked back at a decade of work on usability and considered whether the 34 core guidelines drawn up back then are relevant to the web of today roughly 80 of the things we found 10 years ago are still an issue today he said some have gone away because users have changed and 10 have changed because technology has changed some design crimes such as splash screens that get between a user and the site they are trying to visit and web designers indulging their artistic urges have almost disappeared said dr nielsen but there s great stability on usability concerns he told the bbc news website dr nielsen said the basic principles of usability centring around ease of use and clear thinking about a site s total design were as important as ever it s necessary to be aware of these things as issues because they remain as such he said they are still important because the net has not changed as much as people thought it would a lot of people thought that design and usability was only a temporary problem because broadband was taking off he said but there are a very small number of cases where usability issues go away because you have broadband dr nielsen said the success of sites such as google amazon ebay and yahoo showed that close attention to design and user needs was important those four sites are extremely profitable and extremely successful said dr nielsen adding that they have largely defined commercial success on the net all are based on user empowerment and make it easy for people to do things on the internet he said they are making simple but powerful tools available to the user none of them have a fancy or glamorous look he added declaring himself surprised that these sites have not been more widely copied in the future dr nielsen believes that search engines will play an even bigger part in helping people get to grips with the huge amount of information online they are becoming like the operating system to the internet he said but he said the fact that they are useful now does not meant that they could not do better currently he said search sites did not do a very good job of describing the information that they return in response to queries often people had to look at a website just to judge whether it was useful or not tools that watch the behaviour of people on websites to see what they actually find useful could also help refine results research by dr nielsen shows that people are getting more sophisticated in their use of search engines the latest statistics on how many words people use on search engines shows that on average they use 2 2 terms in 1994 only 1 3 words were used i think it s amazing that we have seen a doubling in a 10 year period of those search terms said dr nielsen you can hear more from jakob nielsen and web design on the bbc world service programme go digital
0,toxic web links help virus spread virus writers have begun using the power of the web to spread their malicious wares a windows virus called bofra is turning infected machines into distributors of its malicious code those clicking on the poisoned links in e mail messages sent out by infected machines may fall victim to the virus the trick is being used to prevent the progam being caught by anti virus software that combs through code contained in e mail attachments the virus that uses this trick is called bofra and the first member of the family of worms appeared on 10 november they exploit a windows vulnerability that was discovered only a few days earlier like many other recent viruses bofra plunders the address book in microsoft outlook for e mail addresses and scours other files on an infected machine for fresh target addresses the virus uses its own mail sending software to despatch e mail messages to potential victims but unlike many other recent viruses does not itself travel via mail instead the body of the mail messages sent out contain fake weblinks that when clicked on connect back to the machine that distributed that e mail essentially bofra turns infected machines into small web servers that happily dole out copies of the virus the messages try to trick people into clicking on the links by promising pornographic videos and images or by posing as payment confirmation for a paypal transaction copies of the messages seen by the bbc news website had bright yellow and green backgrounds those clicking on the links will inadvertently download the bofra virus which will then start searching for new addresses to send itself to filtering firm clearswift said this tactic of creating thousands of mini web servers was designed to help the virus spread quickly and avoid attempts to shut it down in the past other malicious programs have relied on a single web server that downloads viral code to target machines shutting down this central server usually stops the virus spreading clearswift said that fact that no viral code travels in the e mail messages sent out by machines infected by bofra could hamper effects to limit its spread finnish anti virus firm f secure said that so far it had not seen many copies of the bofra virus and its variants in circulation tim warner spokesman for anti virus firm finjan said you have people getting very creative now to deliver the virus and get it propagating mr warner said organisations needed to prepare deep defences to keep out the modern form of malicious mobile code most firms have secured their e mail gateway said mr warner but the irony is that most of them let malicious content through the web gateways he said behavioural systems that monitor what users do can help to spot when viruses have penetrated organisations and have started hunting for other victims the bofra family of viruses which were originally thought to be offshoots of the mydoom bug can infect machines running windows 2000 95 98 me nt xp and server 2003 users running windows xp that have applied the sp2 update are not vulnerable to the loophole that bofra exploits
4,election could be terror target terrorists might try to target the uk in the run up to the election london s most senior police officer has said sir ian blair said terror groups would remember the effect of the madrid bomb on spain s general election last year other potential targets were the royal wedding and the uk s presidency of the european union and g8 he said he refused to say if there was specific information about the risk of a pre poll attack no 10 was similarly cautious but said the threat was real the comments come after tony blair defended his controversial anti terror proposals warning that it would be wrong to wait for an attack before acting sir ian told a meeting of the metropolitan police authority it would be unwise to speculate about whether there was specific information about risks of a pre election attack but he said terrorists have long memories they understand what happened in madrid and know what the impact of that was on the spanish electorate this year we are responsible for the eu presidency presidency of the g8 a royal wedding and a general election there are obvious and enormous targets which we have to deal with sir ian said the debate over anti terror plans was one for politicians not the police who would enforce any new powers home secretary charles clarke has also warned that a madrid style pre election bombing could happen in the uk too asked about sir ian s comments the prime minister s official spokesman said we believe the threat is real the spokesman declined to comment on whether the security services had received specific intelligence relating to a possible attack during the election campaign he said no 10 did not disclose any security advice they received earlier writing in the daily telegraph the prime minister conceded that plans to detain suspects under house arrest without trial were difficult issues for any government the commons has approved the measures despite considerable opposition with the government s majority more than halved as 32 labour rebels joined tory and lib dem opposition but mr blair insisted there is no greater civil liberty than to live free from terrorist attack tory leader michael howard has accused mr blair of steamrolling the house arrest plans and of using national security for political point scoring liberal democrat leader charles kennedy says that the plan is a further example of labour s authoritarian response to crises the prevention of terrorism bill proposes control orders which as well as house arrest could impose curfews tagging or bans on telephone and internet use they would replace current powers to detain foreign terror suspects without trial which the law lords have ruled against but critics are concerned that it would be the home secretary and not judges who decided to impose control orders the plans face further commons scrutiny on monday before passing to the lords

4,brown comes out shooting labour may have abolished hunting but that didn t stop chancellor gordon brown using his budget to fire both barrels at some of the opposition parties core election foxes specifically it saw him attempting to slaughter the council tax as an election issue and to tear limb from limb their wider policies for pensioners and families in a relatively short speech he kept the best for last and was clearly out to give exactly that pre election boost everyone had been predicting so if you are a couple with children a pensioner a patient or a youngster there was something pulled from mr brown s red box in an attempt to persuade you to stick with or switch to a new labour government like a surgeon he attempted to target his handouts with absolute precision onto exactly the groups the government needs to appeal to in the election campaign the announcements brought great cheers from his own mps who are now in full on election mode and had been looking to their man to give them ammunition for the doorsteps they obviously believed he had done that for them and coincidentally given his own image as a prime minister in waiting another little boost labour mps for example will undoubtedly now engage in a debate over exactly how redistributive a lovely old labour word this chancellor really is but gordon brown is never going to put on a show and even as he was out to cast himself as the man who will win labour an historic third term his demeanour remained quiet confident and reassuring prudence made an appearance albeit towards the end of his address as he assured voters he would do nothing to mess up the economic stability he had brought to britain and which he claimed would be thrown away by anyone else according to the opposition parties however it is all one big con trick as always they accused him of glossing over the facts of the black hole at the centre of his finances which they claim would ensure tax increases after the election he did it most obviously with his increase in national insurance contributions after the 2001 election campaign during which he had pledged not to increase income tax as liberal democrat leader charles kennedy claimed for most families the distinction between income tax and a tax on income is meaningless tory leader michael howard said the chancellor was up to his old trick of deliberately re casting his forecasts to give the illusion that everything in the treasury larder is as fresh as the day it was first stored away for future use he branded it a dodgy vote now pay later budget based on dodgy figures from a dodgy government that gave britain the dodgy dossier where the chancellor mostly avoided direct electioneering mr howard felt no such constraint with attacks like comparing mr brown s forecasts to the prime minister s forecasts on iraq s weapons of mass destruction as ever there will now be a period of frantic activity by the opposition parties treasury specialists as they pore over the chancellor s red book which sets out the fine detail of his budget in an attempt to spot the flaws in particular there will be an argument over precisely whose policies on the council tax will offer people the best deal and in labour circles there will undoubtedly be an argument over just how good a prime minister gordon brown will make at some point after the next election

4,councils must find gypsy sites ministers are telling councils to find more sites for travellers amid continuing rows concerning a string of unauthorised encampments councils are also to be given stronger powers to move on illegal settlements by gypsy communities on rural land more money is to be given to councils to develop official caravan parks said housing minister yvette cooper in november mps urged ministers to make councils create sites because 3 500 travellers have no place to stop ms cooper said an annual scheme to refurbish existing traveller sites would now be extended to consider council bids for new stopping places that scheme has paid out 25m in four years with 8m available for 2005 there are two major problems in the planning system at the moment concerning gypsy and traveller sites said ms cooper firstly local authorities are not identifying enough appropriate locations either for private or public sites and secondly they do not have enough powers to deal swiftly with development on inappropriate sites the result is that there are too many developments on inappropriate sites causing tensions and difficulties for both the neighbouring communities and the gypsies and travellers that is why we are consulting on a new obligation on local authorities to identify more appropriate sites as well as new powers to take immediate action if the development is in the wrong place and cannot be tolerated in even the short term because of risk to local amenity and the environment under the new regulations expected to be in force in the spring officials will be able to serve temporary stop notices aimed at preventing works on a site before a council has had chance to obtain a full legal ban many mps with rural constituencies particularly in eastern england have been pressing the government to create stronger enforcement powers saying villagers are suffering because of the legal delays in removing illegal encampments andrew ryder of the traveller law reform coalition said we welcome talk about an obligation on councils to identify land for gypsies and travellers so long as it is a real obligation as opposed to a recommendation which could be and was easily ignored new accommodation proposals for travellers need to be backed up with decent funding and intervention by the government when councils attempt to dodge their responsibilities towards travellers as they often do living on the side of the road or being worn down by planning appeals legal action and eviction is no one s idea of fun in their november report mps from the committee scrutinising the office for the deputy prime minister responsible for housing said most illegal traveller encampments were caused by a lack of places to stop numerous communities and councils were paying for lengthy and expensive evictions against travelling communities said the mps in turn the problems had worsened because councils were reluctant to voluntarily provide sites because of resistance from residents two of the most controversial traveller sites cottenham in cambridgeshire and minety in wiltshire remain embroiled in an ongoing legal battle

0,kenyan school turns to handhelds at the mbita point primary school in western kenya students click away at a handheld computer with a stylus they are doing exercises in their school textbooks which have been digitised it is a pilot project run by eduvision which is looking at ways to use low cost computer systems to get up to date information to students who are currently stuck with ancient textbooks matthew herren from eduvision told the bbc programme go digital how the non governmental organisation uses a combination of satellite radio and handheld computers called e slates the e slates connect via a wireless connection to a base station in the school this in turn is connected to a satellite radio receiver the data is transmitted alongside audio signals the base station processes the information from the satellite transmission and turns it into a form that can be read by the handheld e slates it downloads from the satellite and every day processes the stream sorts through content for the material destined for the users connected to it it also stores this on its hard disc the system is cheaper than installing and maintaining an internet connection and conventional computer network but mr herren says there are both pros and cons to the project it s very simple to set up just a satellite antenna on the roof of the school but it s also a one way connection so getting feedback or specific requests from end users is difficult the project is still at the pilot stage and eduvision staff are on the ground to attend to teething problems with the linux based system the content is divided into visual information textual information and questions users can scroll through these sections independently of each other eduvision is planning to include audio and video files as the system develops and add more content mr herren says this would vastly increase the opportunities available to the students he is currently in negotiations to take advantage of a project being organised by search site google to digitise some of the world s largest university libraries all books in the public domain something like 15 million could be put on the base stations as we manufacture them then every rural school in africa would have access to the same libraries as the students in oxford and harvard currently the project is operating in an area where there is mains electricity but mr herren says eduvision already has plans to extend it to more remote regions we plan to put a solar panel at the school with the base station have the e slates charge during the day when the children are in school then they can take them home at night and continue working maciej sundra who designed the user interface for the e slates says the project s ultimate goal is levelling access to knowledge around the world why in this age when most people do most research using the internet are students still using textbooks the fact that we are doing this in a rural developing country is very exciting as they need it most
2,what now for kelly holmes last april kelly holmes spoke to the bbc sport website about her loneliness her fight to stay fit and her decision not to contest both the 800m and 1500m at the olympics it just goes to show even the most meticulous and measured athletes cannot predict what fate has in store for them four months later holmes stormed to double olympic gold and has since been made a dame won the bbc sport personality of the year and written a book whilst still finding time to coach aspiring athletes with so much time spent in the spotlight holmes has increasingly dropped hints that her ambition on the track has begun to wilt and when asked about her plans for both the indoor and outdoor seasons ahead the 34 year old has repeatedly chosen to tick the don t know box holmes has now pulled out of this weekend s european indoor championships where she was selected for both the 800m and 1500m because of a hamstring injury but should we be surprised if the olympic champion over both those distances decides she just does not feel like racing anymore well it s a lot easier being the double olympic champion being feted by everybody than training to be at the top in middle distance running points out former olympian and bbc pundit steve cram you have to have a real strong desire to carry on doing it even if you re very talented holmes drive and determination have always been unquestionable that is the reason she has battled back from a string of injuries that threatened to see her finish her career empty handed but alarm bells start ringing when the kent athlete begins questioning herself will i have as much commitment desire and energy to go through a major championship holmes asked in the new year that is what i don t know at 34 holmes will also be aware that time is running out us 400m and 200m legend michael johnson a five time olympic gold medallist retired shortly after his 34th birthday as did britain s double olympic champion decathlete daley thompson the physical demands of the day to day grind will only get harder for holmes who has already admitted she doesn t like the training anymore whilst out on the circuit the allure of defeating a double olympic champion will spur her opponents on holmes will not want to needlessly suffer the indignity of being beaten unless she is certain she has a strong chance of winning any race she will not step onto the track but if the kent athlete finds the form that fuelled her ambitions last summer there are more prizes up for grabs the day after completing her double in athens the 34 year old revealed she would still like to win her first indoors title holmes wish could easily be met in madrid before she goes on to prepare for the outdoor season where there are still scores to be settled such as a first gold at the world championships in helsinki there is just one small truth which could gnaw away at holmes motivation the realisation that no matter how hard she trains nothing she wins now can surpass her achievements in athens on the other hand if those achievements cannot be matched shouldn t they be at least shared and celebrated you don t get the chance very often in your career to step onto the track as the double olympic champion agreed cram you want to be able to take your bow in front of the fans because it s a fantastic feeling i think deep down kelly wants to run i think she will compete and run races on the circuits but whether or not she runs in the major championships is much less certain athletics fans had every reason to believe they would see the new look kelly holmes tearing up the track again after her olympic glory she emphatically denied she planned to retire so why is holmes dragging her heels about making a decision on where when or whether to even bother competing again that s just kelly explains cram she s always been like that she enjoys people trying to guess what she is going to do next she knows every time she makes a pronouncement now it s headline news kelly has to figure out for herself what it is she wants and that will be based on athletics decisions whether she can be competitive if she is fit enough to put her neck on the line and if she decides not to run again no one is going to turn round and say you re making the wrong decision

0,the force is strong in battlefront the warm reception that has greeted star wars battlefront is a reflection not of any ingenious innovation in its gameplay but of its back to basics approach and immense nostalgia quotient geared towards online gamers it is based around little more than a series of all out gunfights set in an array of locations all featured in or hinted at during the two blockbusting film trilogies previous star wars titles like the acclaimed knights of the old republic and jedi knight have regularly impressed with their imaginative forays into the far corners of the franchise s extensive universe and their use of weird and wonderful new characters battlefront on the other hand wholeheartedly revisits the most recognisable elements of the hit movies themselves the sights sounds and protagonists on show here will all be instantly familiar to fans who may well feel that the opportunity to relive star wars most memorable screen skirmishes makes this the game they have always waited for the mayhem can be viewed from either a third or first person perspective and you can either fight for the forces of freedom or join darth vader on the dark side depending on the episode and type of campaign as well as the player s personal propensity for good or evil there is ample chance to be a wookie shoot ewoks and rush into battle alongside a fired up luke skywalker in each section the task is simply to wipe out enemy troops seize strategic waypoints and move on to the next planet it really is no more complicated than that locations include the frozen wastes of hoth the ice planet from the empire strikes back complete with massive mechanical at ats on the march there are also the dusty sinister deserts of tatooine and geonosis as well as the forest moon of endor where return of the jedi s much maligned ewoks lived the feel of those places is well and truly captured with both backdrops and characters looking good and very authentic it is worth noting though that on the playstation 2 the game s graphics are a curiously long way behind those of the xbox version the pivotal element behind battlefront s success is that it successfully gives you the feel of being of being plunged into the midst of large scale war the number of combatants noise and abundance of laser fire see to that and the sense of chaos really comes over speaking of noise battlefront is a real testament to the strength of the star wars galaxy s audio motifs the multitude of distinctive weapon and vehicle noises are immensely familiar as are the stirring john williams symphonies that never let up there is also a particularly snazzy remix of one of his themes in the menu section it has to be said if the game did not have the boon of being star wars it would not stand up for long the gameplay is reliable bog standard stuff short on originality there are also odd annoyances like the game s insistence on re spawning you miles away from the action an irritating price to pay for not getting blown up the second you appear and some of the weapons and vehicles are not as responsive and fluid to operate as they might be that said it is still great fun to pilot a scout walker or speeder bike however non user friendly they prove whilst it is firmly designed with multiplayer action in mind battlefront is actually perfectly good fun as an offline game the above average ai of the enemy sees to that although given the frenetic environments they operate in their strategic behaviour does not need to be all that sophisticated battlefront s novelty value will doubtless wear off relatively fast leaving behind a slightly empty one trick pony of a game but for a while it is an absolute blast and one of the most immediately satisfying video game offerings yet from george lucas stable

1,us trade deficit widens sharply the gap between us exports and imports has widened to more than 60bn 31 7bn an all time record figures from the commerce department for november showed exports down 2 3 to 95 6bn while imports grew 1 3 to 155 8bn on rising consumer demand part of the expanding deficit came from high prices for oil imports but the numbers suggested the sliding dollar which makes exports less expensive has had little impact and could indicate slowing economic growth the trade deficit far bigger than the 54bn widely expected on wall street prompted a rapid response from the currency markets by 1650 gmt the dollar was trading against the euro at 1 3280 almost a cent and a half weaker than before the announcement against the pound the dollar was down about 0 7 at 1 8923 the dollar s fall has been sudden violent and appropriate given this number said brian taylor of wells fargo in minneapolis recent exchange rate movements certainly haven t had any impact yet treasury secretary john snow put a brave face on the news saying it was a sign of strong economic expansion the economy is growing at such a fast rate that it is generating lots of disposable income some of which is used to buy goods from our trading partners although the white house officially still backs the us s traditional strong dollar policy it has tacitly indicated that it would be happy if the slide continued the dollar has fallen by 50 against the euro as well as by 30 against the yen in the past three years the main catalyst most economists accept is the large budget deficit on the one hand and the current account deficit the difference between the flow of money in and out of the us on the other the trade deficit is a large part of the latter in november the fall in exports was largely due to a decline in sales of industrial supplies and materials such as chemicals as well as of cars consumer goods and food one small bright spot for us policy makers was a slight decline in the deficit with china often blamed for job losses and other economic woes although china s overall trade surplus is expanding according to chinese government figures the commerce department revealed the us s deficit with china was 19 6bn in november down from 19 7bn the month before but the deficit with japan was at its worst in more than four years

0,kenyan school turns to handhelds at the mbita point primary school in western kenya students click away at a handheld computer with a stylus they are doing exercises in their school textbooks which have been digitised it is a pilot project run by eduvision which is looking at ways to use low cost computer systems to get up to date information to students who are currently stuck with ancient textbooks matthew herren from eduvision told the bbc programme go digital how the non governmental organisation uses a combination of satellite radio and handheld computers called e slates the e slates connect via a wireless connection to a base station in the school this in turn is connected to a satellite radio receiver the data is transmitted alongside audio signals the base station processes the information from the satellite transmission and turns it into a form that can be read by the handheld e slates it downloads from the satellite and every day processes the stream sorts through content for the material destined for the users connected to it it also stores this on its hard disc the system is cheaper than installing and maintaining an internet connection and conventional computer network but mr herren says there are both pros and cons to the project it s very simple to set up just a satellite antenna on the roof of the school but it s also a one way connection so getting feedback or specific requests from end users is difficult the project is still at the pilot stage and eduvision staff are on the ground to attend to teething problems with the linux based system the content is divided into visual information textual information and questions users can scroll through these sections independently of each other eduvision is planning to include audio and video files as the system develops and add more content mr herren says this would vastly increase the opportunities available to the students he is currently in negotiations to take advantage of a project being organised by search site google to digitise some of the world s largest university libraries all books in the public domain something like 15 million could be put on the base stations as we manufacture them then every rural school in africa would have access to the same libraries as the students in oxford and harvard currently the project is operating in an area where there is mains electricity but mr herren says eduvision already has plans to extend it to more remote regions we plan to put a solar panel at the school with the base station have the e slates charge during the day when the children are in school then they can take them home at night and continue working maciej sundra who designed the user interface for the e slates says the project s ultimate goal is levelling access to knowledge around the world why in this age when most people do most research using the internet are students still using textbooks the fact that we are doing this in a rural developing country is very exciting as they need it most

1,call to overhaul uk state pension the uk pension system has been branded inadequate and too complex by a leading retirement think tank the pensions policy institute ppi said replacing the state pension with a citizen s pension would help tackle inequality and complexity the change would see pensions being calculated on length of residency in the uk rather than national insurance ni contributions reform could reduce poverty by aiding people with broken employment records the ppi added that once the state system was reformed the government should look at options to overhaul private and workplace pensions the think tank s proposals were made in response to the recent publication of the pensions commission s initial report into uk retirement savings according to the pensions commission s report 12 million working people are not saving enough for their retirement as a result living standards could fall for the next generation of uk pensioners the report added that a combination of higher taxes higher savings and or a higher average retirement age was needed to solve the uk pension crisis

2,mourinho plots impressive course chelsea s win at fulham confirming their position at the premiership summit proves that they now have everything in place to mount serious challenges on all fronts this season they have got strength in depth great players an outstanding manager in jose mourinho and finances no other club in the world can match all they need to add now is the big prizes which as we all know is the most difficult part of all one thing is certain they have put themselves in a position to make that leap to success very impressively indeed they beat a very tough everton at stamford bridge won at newcastle in the carling cup and then won 4 1 at fulham which was a great result given that they had been showing good form as i said winning the major honours is the hardest task of all but in mourinho they have a manager who will make it a whole lot easier to handle the anticipation and expectation that will come their way now mourinho has won the biggest club prize of all the champions league and that track record and confidence transmits itself to top players it is a priceless commodity no one can be anything other than highly impressed by mourinho he is regarded as a touch arrogant by some people and maybe he can appear that way but he has the silverware to back up the talk mourinho doesn t simply talk a good game he s won some very big games such as the champions league final with porto some may criticise his talk but the words are backed up with actions i ve also found him to be very realistic whenever i ve heard him he s spent a lot of money and it seems to be working and we should remember lots of managers have spent money and it has not worked the buys are now integrating and in arjen robben he has the player who is giving them that extra dimension in the early games he was slaughtered for defensive tactics and yet he was winning games you cannot win titles early on in the season but you can certainly lose them and those points on the board were vital i also thought the criticism was very harsh because even though they were not scoring goals they were creating chances by the hatful now they are taking those chances have the double threat of robben and damien duff and things are looking good i just wonder if they lack a predator particularly with didier drogba injured he was starting to look the part before he was sidelined but you have to feel if chelsea had a ruud van nistelrooy they would be even more of a safe bet for the title chelsea also have all the tools to go far in the champions league i felt they would never have a better chance than last season but they have swept all before them in europe so far this season it will now be very interesting to see how mourinho prioritises things but his life will be made easier by the size of chelsea s squad i have said i believed chelsea would win the league this season even when arsenal were flying at the start and i have seen nothing to make me change me mind if anything what i have seen has confirmed my early impressions and chelsea would have taken encouragement from arsenal s rocky defensive display at spurs even though they ran out 5 4 winners mourinho had his say on that game complaining five four is a hockey score not a football score in a three against three training match if the score reaches 5 4 i send the players back to the dressing rooms as they are not defending properly so to get a result like that in a game of 11 against 11 is disgraceful on a more serious note it was a game that merely confirmed the importance of sol campbell to arsenal much criticism has been aimed at pascal cygan but i believe the problem lies with the absence of campbell and its overall effect on arsenal s defence confidence is a crucial factor in defending when you start conceding goals you suddenly get a chill in the bones every time the ball comes into the penalty area you think oh no then find your worst fears confirmed arsenal need to reverse the process with or without campbell and get some clean sheets on the board but the return of campbell is key he solidifies the unit has pace and is powerful in the air and on the deck he is vastly experienced and has a calming influence on all around him campbell pulls it all together at the back and gets the defence playing as a unit chelsea have no such problems at present which is why i would still place my money on them to edge out arsenal as champions this season

1,us budget deficit to reach 368bn the us budget deficit is set to hit a worse than expected 368bn 197bn this year officials said on tuesday the cost of military operations still needs to be factored in with analysts saying the deficit could end up a further 100bn in the red past congressional budget office cbo forecasts said there would be a 348bn shortfall in the 2005 fiscal year in recent months the dollar has weakened amid market jitters about the size of the budget and trade deficits in november the gap between us exports and imports widened to more than 60bn a record figure the cbo says it envisages a further orderly decline in the greenback over the next two years as the twin deficit drives dollar investors away but the non partisan fiscal watchdog notes the declines will help exporters and boost us economic growth the budget deficit hit a record 412bn in the 12 months to 30 september 2004 after reaching 377bn in the previous fiscal year the cbo also forecast a total shortfall of 855bn for the years from 2006 to 2015 an improvement on previous projections however analysts say the new figures fail to take into account the potential 2 3 8 trillion costs of the president s plan to revamp state pensions and extend tax cuts the figure could also be worsened by any further military costs republicans have blamed the size of the deficit on slow economic conditions after the 11 september attacks and ongoing military operations in iraq and afghanistan one of president george w bush s election pledges was to halve the budget deficit within five years but democrats have accused the president of excluding iraq related costs from previous budgets to meet the aim of reducing the deficit a charge which the administration denies on tuesday the us administration asked congress for additional funds for military operations
4,will tory tax cuts lift spirits michael howard has finally revealed the full scale of his planned tory tax cuts should he win the next general election he has earmarked 4 billion that will be used to reduce taxes although he still will not say which or how this was the pre election message many in his party have been pressing for and voters he believes will warm to at its simplest it is saying vote tory and you can have it both ways not only would his government stick to labour spending plans on core public services including health and education it would increase spending on defence police and pensions and even after that was done it would still have enough left over for a tax cut equivalent to about a penny off the basic rate of income tax all the money would come from its 35 billion efficiency savings which would see the axe taken to bureaucracy waste and the civil service of that 23 billion would go on spending plans with 8 billion to fill the black hole left they claim by gordon brown and the rest going in tax cuts neither mr howard nor mr letwin would say exactly how they would use that cash although a cut in the basic rate seems unlikely ideas already floated include raising tax thresholds and abolishing or reducing inheritance tax although some in the tory party are urging mr howard to announce something more eye catching before the election as the tory leader declared the aim of the exercise is to open up a real economic policy divide between labour and the tories at this election people will have a clear choice between mr blair who will waste more and tax more and the conservative party which will give value for money and tax less he said it is a move back towards an almost traditional tory message which previously suggested labour was the party of tax rises and the conservatives the party of tax cuts the extension of that however was that labour was also seen as the party of big spending on the public services while the tories were the cutters and that is where one of the problems lies for mr howard can he persuade sceptical voters that they really can have it both ways with bigger spending on public services and lower taxes he insists he will not promise anything before the election that he cannot deliver if put into downing street labour needless to say claim his planned 35bn efficiency savings simply don t add up and that those sorts of figures are fantasy one of new labour s greatest successes before the historic 1997 election was to persuade voters business and the city that it could be trusted to run the economy so far that has not faced any real challenge but independent analysts now claim a third new labour government would be forced to either increase taxation or taxes to plug a black hole it has at the centre of its finances meanwhile the liberal democrats are committed to increasing taxes for the most well off to finance their spending proposals launched earlier in the day so mr howard hopes his message will start to hit home during this unofficial election campaign and that his poll ratings might finally lift off the floor and while other issues like the iraq war and trust will play a major part in that campaign it is likely and the prime minister probably hopes that the economy will be the deciding factor

1,iraqi voters turn to economic issues beyond the desperate security situation in iraq lies an economy in tatters a vicious cycle of unemployment poor social services and poverty has been made worse by a lack of investment so there is much hope that an elected government will break the deadlock first rule of law then the economy says radwan hadi deputy managing director of aberdeen based oil and gas consultancy blackwatch petroleum services which entered iraq in 2003 mr hadi s view about what the new government s priorities should be is shared by many iraqis the economy has become the second most dominant issue for many political parties ahead of sunday s election according to bristol university political scientist anne alexander who is working on a project that looks at governance and security in post war iraq job creation ranks high both on election manifestos and on the iraqi people s wish list nobody knows exactly how many iraqis are out of work but it is clear that the situation is dire estimates of iraq s unemployment rate vary but we estimate it to be between 30 40 the washington based independent think tank the brookings institution says in its iraq index but some progress has been made largely thanks to the country s oil revenues which have exceeded 22bn since june 2003 iraq s infrastructure is on the mend with notable improvements having been made in areas such as electricity supply irrigation telephone networks and the re opening of hospitals but serious problems remain and the growing divide between haves and have nots is angering voters one iraqi woman told ms alexander about her frustration as she watched tv adverts for private hospitals soon after having failed to track down basic medicines from baghdad s pharmacies observes mr hadi the economy at present marks a big divide the rich get richer the poor get poorer an indication of this can be seen in the world of finance where in contrast with the daily plight of ordinary people 19 private banks operate only one of which is run in accordance with islamic banking principles hopes are high for the future of finance so foreign banks have been buying into the sector national bank of kuwait has bought a majority stake in credit bank of iraq the jordanian investment bank export finance bank has bought 49 of national bank of iraq foreign firms also hope to cash in on the reconstruction effort bechtel s efforts to rebuild schools and restore power have attracted controversy as well as boosting its bottom line while halliburton has enjoyed a wealth of military contracts but the involvement of foreign firms in the health and banking sectors and beyond sits uneasily with many iraqis who are accustomed to the state taking responsibility for functions that are essential to making society work observes ms alexander it is seen as a selling off of iraq s assets and bringing in multinationals at the expense of iraqi businesses and iraqi workers she says consequently the transitional government has been forced to backtrack in recent months over its proposal to allow 100 foreign ownership of iraqi assets she explains in the west it is easy to forget that the otherwise brutal baathist regime used to look after the majority of iraq s citizens rather well in terms of job creation social security and healthcare opinion polls suggest that people still want the state to take a leading role in providing these things ms alexander says yet in some areas of the economy investment from abroad is still warmly welcomed insists mr hadi an iraqi who left the country three decades ago i think the private sector will evolve incredibly fast mr hadi says iraq s vast natural resources can support any magnitude of economic growth many foreign companies say they are keen to get in on the act yet few are actually entering the country in any meaningful way but there are exceptions mr hadi s blackwatch is just one of many small operators preparing for a much bigger future blackwatch s baghdad based affiliate falcon group has dozens of people working for it across the country in kirkuk and baghdad and its engineers and geo scientists work with the iraqi oil ministry to hammer out technology transfer issues mr hadi points out these guys are trying to work the iraqi business people will do business at all times life goes on in iraq the people take responsibility they want to live normal lives
2,record fails to lift lacklustre meet yelena isinbayeva may have produced another world pole vault record but her achievement could not hide the fact it was not the best meet we have ever seen in birmingham and hey there are not many meets that go by without the russian breaking a world record apparently isinbayeva has cleared five metres in training and i would just love her to put us out of our misery and have a go at it rather than extending the indoor record by one centimetre at a time athletics to me is all about pushing the barriers and being the best you can and i would like to see her have a go at 5m in competition mind you every time she breaks the record she gets 30 000 so she can afford to be deliberate about it world records aside i thought it was a very encouraging evening s work for kelly holmes she looked good and was very positive agnes samaria who came second is in very good shape and is in the world s top three 800m runners this season yes samaria let kelly get away but there was no coming back over the last 200m as kelly dominated the race so beating samaria is a bit of a benchmark for kelly my gut feeling is that kelly would like to run in the european indoor championships but she just hasn t convinced herself she is fit enough to do so on the other hand i think jason gardener is struggling to come near what is going to be required to win the men s 60m in madrid he started well in the final but still could not stay with the front runners jason has a lot of experience indoors but for some reason he is struggling to maintain his pace through to the finish it would have been nice to see what mark lewis francis could have done in the final if only he hadn t got himself disqualified he was blatantly playing the false start game to his advantage but it tripped him up and made him look a bit silly my view is you re meant to go when the gun goes and not before and if you try to unsettle your rivals by employing the false start tactic you have to remember not to false start yourself again having said that mark is looking in much better shape but i haven t seen anything from mark or jason yet which suggests france s ronald pognon who has run 6 45 seconds will be under threat at the europeans from a british point of view sarah claxton s victory in the 60m hurdles was the best thing to come out of the meet something else that probably went unnoticed was melanie purkiss winning the women s national 400m race in a new personal best of 52 98 seconds aaas champion kim wall came second in another lifetime best so we have a very strong 4x400m squad going to the european championships scotland s lee mcconnell is probably going to run too so we have a real prospect of a medal from an international perspective i thought meseret defar was disappointing in the 3 000m but i don t think the pace making was great canadian heather hennigar set a fast early pace but could not maintain it and if jo pavey had been in last year s shape she would have given defar a real run for her money she had a go but just could not hang in there we were also expecting a bit more from bernard lagat in the men s 1500m but he has only just come over from the usa so he may not be that sharp and i still think he is in great shape as for kenenisa bekele he was well beaten by markos geneti but we only had half expectations for bekele as he has been struggling this season it was very hot in the national indoor arena and i felt uncomfortable in the commentary box i think those conditions affected the distance runners and in fact defar complained to her coach after the race that she could not get her breath properly

0,savvy searchers fail to spot ads internet search engine users are an odd mix of naive and sophisticated suggests a report into search habits the report by the us pew research center reveals that 87 of searchers usually find what they were looking for when using a search engine it also shows that few can spot the difference between paid for results and organic ones the report reveals that 84 of net users say they regularly use google ask jeeves msn and yahoo when online almost 50 of those questioned said they would trust search engines much less if they knew information about who paid for results was being hidden according to figures gathered by the pew researchers the average users spends about 43 minutes per month carrying out 34 separate searches and looks at 1 9 webpages for each hunt a significant chunk of net users 36 carry out a search at least weekly and 29 of those asked only look every few weeks for 44 of those questioned the information they are looking for is critical to what they are doing and is information they simply have to find search engine users also tend to be very loyal and once they have found a site they feel they can trust tend to stick with it according to pew research 44 of searchers use just a single search engine 48 use two or three and a small number 7 consult more than three sites tony macklin spokesman for ask jeeves said the results reflected its own research which showed that people use different search engines because the way the sites gather information means they can provide different results for the same query despite this liking for search sites half of those questioned said they could get the same information via other routes a small number 17 said they wouldn t really miss search engines if they did not exist the remaining 33 said they could not live without search sites more than two thirds of those questioned 68 said they thought that the results they were presented with were a fair and unbiased selection of the information on a topic that can be found on the net alongside the growing sophistication of net users is a lack of awareness about paid for results that many search engines provide alongside lists of websites found by indexing the web of those asked 62 were unaware that someone has paid for some of the results they see when they carry out a search only 18 of all searchers say they can tell which results are paid for and which are not said the pew report this finding is ironic since nearly half of all users say they would stop using search engines if they thought engines were not being clear about how they presented paid results commenting mr macklin said sponsored results must be clearly marked and though they might help with some queries user testing showed that people need to be able to spot the difference

0,gadget growth fuels eco concerns technology firms and gadget lovers are being urged to think more about the environment when buying and disposing of the latest hi tech products at the consumer electronics show in las vegas earlier this month several hi tech firms were recognised for their strategies to help the environment ebay also announced the rethink project bringing together intel apple and ibm among others to promote recycling the us consumer electronics market is set to grow by over 11 in 2005 but more awareness is needed about how and where old gadgets can be recycled as well as how to be more energy efficient said the us environmental protection agency epa of particular growing concern is how much energy it takes to recharge portable devices one of the fastest growing markets in technology the consumer electronics association cea has predicted that shipments of consumer technologies in 2005 will reach more than 125 73 billion nearly 68 billion ebay s initiative pulls together major technology firms environment groups government agencies and ebay users to give information about what to do with old computers and where to send them the online auction house thinks that its already established community of loyal users could be influential we really became aware of the e waste issue and we saw that our 125 million users can be a powerful force for good ebay s david stern told the bbc news website we saw the opportunity to meet the additional demand we have on the site for used computers and saw the opportunity too to good some good for the environment but it is not just computers that cause a problem for the environment teenagers get a new mobile every 11 months adults every 18 months and a 15 million handsets are replaced in total each year yet only 15 are actually recycled this year a predicted two billion people worldwide will own a mobile according to a deloitte report schemes in the us like ripmobile could help in targeting younger generations with recycling messages the initiative which was also launched at ces rewards 10 to 28 year olds for returning unused phones this system allows for the transformation of a drawer full of unused mobile phones into anything from music to clothes to electronics or games said seth heine from ripmobile one group of students collected 1 000 mobiles for recycling in just three months mr heine told the bbc news website that what was important was to raise awareness amongst the young so that recycling becomes learned behaviour europe is undoubtedly more advanced than the us in terms of recycling awareness and robust end of life programmes although there is a tide change happening in the rest of the world too intel showcased some its motherboards and chips at ces which are entirely lead free there is more and more awareness on the consumer side but the whole industry is moving towards being lead free intel s allen wilson told the bbc news website there is still low level awareness right now but it is on the rise the highest level of awareness is in europe a european union eu directive weee waste electronic and electrical equipment comes into effect in august it puts the responsibility on electrical manufacturers to recycle items that are returned to them but developments are also being made to design better technologies which are more energy efficient and which do not contain harmful substances elements like chromium lead and cadmium common in consumer electronics goods will be prohibited in all products in the eu by 2006 but it is not just about recycling either the predicted huge growth in the gadget market means the amount of energy used to power them up is on the rise too the biggest culprit according to the epa is the innocuous power adaptor nicknamed energy vampires they provide vital juice for billions of mobile phones pdas personal digital assistants digital cameras camcorders and digital music players although there is a focus on developing efficient and improved circuits in the devices themselves the technologies inside rechargers are still outdated and so eat up more energy than is needed to power a gadget on 1 january new efficiency standards for external power supplies came into effect as part of the european commission code of conduct but at ces the epa also unveiled new guidelines for its latest energy star initiative which targets external power adapters these map out the framework for developing better adaptors that can be labelled with an energy star logo meaning they are about 35 more efficient the initiative is a global effort and more manufacturers adaptors are being brought on board most are made in china about two billion are shipped global every year and about three billion are in use in the us alone the epa is already working with several companies which make more than 22 of power supplies on the market we are increasingly finding companies that not only want to provide neat hi tech devices but also bundle with it a hi tech efficient power supply the epa s andrew fanara said initiatives like this are critical if power adaptors continue to be made and used as they are now consumer electronics and other small appliances will be responsible for more than 40 of electricity used in us homes said the epa

2,radcliffe tackles marathon tasks paula radcliffe faces arguably the biggest test of her career in the new york city marathon on sunday back under the spotlight of public scrutiny she will attempt to erase the double disappointment of the athens olympics where she failed to finish the marathon and then the 10 000m bbc sport examines the challenges facing radcliffe ahead of the big race the ability to run a gruelling 26 2 miles relies largely upon an athlete s belief that they can do it every runner will hit the wall at some stage and see written on it are you strong enough to finish the question could hit radcliffe hard after she was unable to complete her last two races in high profile and emotional circumstances sports psychologist hugh richards says the 30 year old must draw on her past achievements to conquer a potential crisis of confidence there is an old adage get straight back on the horse that threw you richards told bbc sport paula has got all those great runs in her history as well as the two upsets in athens she must not lose faith in what has already been proven is a very effective strategy for distance running if she were to change her preparation and tactics that would be madness she wants to start rebuilding her confidence through performance accomplishment for much of the watching media and public there can only be two possible outcomes in new york win or lose if radcliffe crosses the line first she will have proved her critics wrong but if she fails to triumph she risks being labelled a has been and her profile will suffer and for any athlete that can have repercussions in terms of sponsorship appearance fees as well as further self esteem issues athletes need to try and stay focused on their internal controls and ignore external questions explains richards who has worked with past olympians she must not get caught up in someone else s agenda radcliffe s best friend and fellow distance runner liz yelling revealed the 30 year old is already aware she will be exposing herself to more public scrutiny in new york she just thought well they can t think any worse of me now yelling told bbc sport she s just doing what she wants to do and not thinking about the consequences of it radcliffe described her decision to enter the new york marathon as impulsive but she is certain to have a tick list of personal goals her aims could be as simple as completing a race and making sure she is still enjoying running but richards says she must avoid more emotional targets such as redemption you can t change history warned richards only one person can win the marathon but lots of people can be successful paula has to figure out what sort of things will she feel satisfied achieving by the end of the race the course from staten island to central park is renowned as one of the toughest in the world it is also not the kind of fast course that tends to suit radcliffe better with the undulating finish through the park testing the legs final reserves radcliffe has never raced there before and will enter the unknown just 77 days after the athens marathon it s suggested after a major marathon you take a full month off and start building up again said yelling herself a marathon runner but that is only for long term health and fitness when you finish a marathon you are still very fit and can recover quickly so physically it is possible for paula richards also points out conditions in new york will be more conducive to a strong physical display from radcliffe the heat stress was the primary factor that tripped her up in athens he said and that just isn t going to be there in new york that s been taken out of the equation radcliffe concedes she will probably learn a lot from her bad experiences in athens in time and richards and yelling agree she could turn the trauma to her advantage starting in new york how you respond to adversity is what marks you out as elite or not argues richards one of the challenges of massive set backs is how you turn them into opportunities and yelling says i think this will probably make paula i think it will drive her on and she ll come out of it a better athlete

4,defection timed to hit tax pledge with impeccable and precisely calculated timing tory defector robert jackson and his new labour bosses have attempted to overshadow michael howard s latest announcement on taxation and spending with just about everyone in westminster now working towards a may general election mr howard is eager to map out some clear and distinctive policies aimed at finally shifting the tories resolutely depressing poll showings the big idea is his 35bn savings on waste and bureaucracy which mr howard has pledged to plough back into public services and tax cuts and it was virtually certain his pledge on tax cuts was meant to be the core message from his interview on the bbc one s breakfast with frost programme he and his shadow chancellor oliver letwin have been edging towards an announcement on this front for some months now but without any concrete pledges but mr howard announced that of the 35bn he has earmarked from savings 12bn will be used to plug labour s claimed financial black hole with any left over going to tax cuts in mr letwin s first budget he would not be precise but there are already suggestions he is set to announce lifting the threshold on income tax and reforming or abolishing inheritance tax but he did for the first time say there would be such tax cuts at this election people will have a clear choice between mr blair who will waste more and tax more and the conservative party which will give value for money and tax less it is the tories attempt to open that famed clear blue water between them and the labour party and return to a traditional tory agenda that will both reassure the middle england voters who have abandoned him and appeal to core conservative voters so it is a pretty safe bet to assume that when robert jackson finally decided to jump ship and swim over to the labour benches his new masters decided to time the announcement for the greatest possible impact mr howard however was dismissive these things happen from time to time there are disagreements between robert jackson and me the election is not going to be decided on what robert jackson did he added and that is certainly true the election will be decided on the economy stupid other issues like the iraq war and the trust thing will also play a major part but it is the economy that will probably be the greatest influence over the way people finally vote and many on the tory benches have been crying out for mr howard to get back onto the old tory tax cuts agenda mr howard knows that risks accusations that as a result he would slash public services so he has attempted to shoot that fox first with polls suggesting voters would rather any government cash surpluses were spent on schools and hospitals before tax cuts he has suggested that is exactly what he will do whether this will finally be enough to shift those polls remains to be seen
1,further rise in uk jobless total the uk s jobless total rose for the second month in a row in december official figures show the number of people out of work rose 32 000 to 1 41 million in the last three months of 2004 even as 90 000 more people were in employment average earnings rose by 4 3 in the year to december up from november s 4 2 the office for national statistics ons added meanwhile the benefit claimant total fell 11 000 to 813 200 last month throughout 2004 the number of people in work increased by 296 000 to 28 52 million the highest figure since records began in 1971 the apparent discrepancy between rising unemployment and record numbers in work can be explained by an increase in the working population and a fall in those who are economically inactive while the uk s jobless rate rose to 4 7 from 4 6 in the previous quarter the rate still remains one of the lowest in the world compared with 12 1 in germany 10 4 in spain and 9 7 in france but despite more people being in work the manufacturing sector continued to suffer with 104 000 workers axed during the last quarter of 2004 pushing employment in the sector to a record low of 3 24 million by the end of last year the figures prompted some analysts to forecast that the bank of england will almost certainly raise rates this year marc ostwald a strategist at monument securities told reuters that while no immediate market impact could be expected it is enough to underline that they the boe will be more hawkish on rates

0,what high definition will do to dvds first it was the humble home video then it was the dvd and now hollywood is preparing for the next revolution in home entertainment high definition high definition gives incredible 3d like pictures and surround sound the dvd disks and the gear to play them will not be out for another year or so and there at are still a number of issues to be sorted out but when high definition films do come out on the new format dvds it will profoundly change home entertainment for rick dean director of business development for digital content company thx a high definition future is an exciting prospect he has worked on the star wars dvd trilogy finding nemo the incredibles and indiana jones there was a time not so long ago when the film world and the video world were two completely separate worlds he told the bbc news website the technology we are dealing with now means they are very much conjoined the film that we see in theatres is coming from the same digital file that we take the home video master he says but currently putting a master feature film onto dvd requires severe compression because current dvd technology cannot hold as much as high definition films demand as much as you compress the picture data rate wise you also take qualities away from the picture that we fight so hard to keep in the master he explains i would love to be able to show people what projects that we worked on really look like in the high def world and i find it very exciting high definition dvds can hold up to six times more data than the dvds we are used to it will take time though to persuade people who spent money on dvd players to buy the different players and displays required to watch high definition dvds in 18 months time mr dean is confident though i think if they see real hd high definition not some heavily compressed version of it there is such a remarkable difference i have heard comments from people who say the images pop off the screen high definition will mean some changes for those working behind the scenes too on the whole producing films for high definition dvds will be easier in some ways because less compression is needed equally it may mean hollywood studios ask for more to be put onto the average dvd when we master movies right now our data rates are running at about 1 2 gigabits per second says mr dean our dvds that we put out today have to be squashed down to about five or six megabits per second that s a huge amount of compression that has to be applied about 98 so if you have anything that allows more space you don t have to compress so hard studios could fit a lot more marketing material games and features onto high capacity dvds currently an entire dvd project can take up to three months says mr dean although the step of down converting will be bypassed this will realistically only save a day s work says mr dean one of the most time consuming elements is building dvd navigation and menu systems on the fairly complex star wars disks making sure the menu buttons worked took 45 human hours alone if studios want to cash in on the extra space it could mean extra human hours for which someone has to pay if the decision on the studio side is that they are going to put a lot more on these disks it could be more expensive because of all the extra navigation that is required and if studios do focus on delivering more added value content thinks mr dean ultimately it could mean that they will want more money for it those costs could filter down to the price ticket on a high definition dvd but if the consumer is not willing to pay a premium price studios will listen thinks mr dean high definition throws up other challenge to film makers and dvd production alike more clarity on screen means film makers have to make doubly sure that attention to detail is meticulous when we did the first hd version of star wars episode i everybody was very sun tanned but that was make up in the hd version of episode i all these make up lines showed up explains mr dean the restoration of the older star wars episodes revealed some interesting items too there are scans of a corridor on the death star and fairly plainly in one of those shots there is a file cabinet stuck behind one of the doorways you never used to be able to see it because things are just blurred enough during the pan that you just didn t see it what high definition revolution ultimately means is that the line between home entertainment and cinema worlds will blur with home theatre systems turning living rooms into cinemas this line blurs even further it could also mean that how we get films and in what format will widen in the future we are going to look towards file delivery over ip internet protocol broadband giving a dvd like experience from the set top box to the hard drive says mr dean but that is some time off for most and for now people still like to show off something physical in their bookshelves
1,ban on forced retirement under 65 employers will no longer be able to force workers to retire before 65 unless they can justify it the government has announced that firms will be barred from 2006 from imposing arbitrary retirement ages under new european age discrimination rules a default retirement age of 65 will be introduced workers will be permitted to request staying on beyond this compulsory retirement age although employers will have the right to refuse trade and industry secretary patricia hewitt said people would not be forced to work longer than they wanted saying the default age was not a statutory compulsory retirement age she said employers would be free to continue employing people for as long as they were competent under age discrimination proposals from the department of trade and industry last year workers were to be allowed to work on till 70 if they wished business leaders had opposed the plan as they said it would be too costly and cumbersome the british chambers of commerce welcomed the latest proposal this move today is the best of both worlds it said employers have the ability to define the end point of the employer employee relationship and employees have flexibility with a right to request to work past the age of 65 but age concern said imposing a retirement age of 65 was cowardly and a complete u turn this makes a mockery of the government s so called commitment to outlawing ageism leaving the incoming age discrimination law to unravel said gordon lishman director general of age concern england it is now inevitable that older people will mount legal challenges to the decision using european law the decision will have no impact on the age at which workers can collect their state pension the government has said

4,student inequality exposed teenagers from well off backgrounds are six times more likely to go to university than those from the most deprived areas a report says the higher education funding council for england said more people went to university between 1994 and 2000 but the percentage of poorer students hardly changed at all said its chief executive sir howard newby increasingly more women than men went to university while tuition fees and student loans made no major difference the hefce report drawing on child benefits data said teenagers in the richest areas could expect a better than 50 chance of going to university while in the poorest neighbourhoods it was 10 participation at constituency level ranged from 69 in kensington and chelsea 65 in the city of london and westminster and 62 in sheffield hallam down to 10 in bristol south and leeds central and 8 in nottingham north and sheffield brightside sir howard said the report highlighted the entrenched divisions between rich and poor areas but added it was a social as much as an educational problem he told bbc news we know once children from deprived backgrounds get into university they do very well in fact surprisingly more go into postgraduate study than those from more affluent backgrounds the issue is i think one of raising aspirations amongst those families and those communities that university is something for them and not for other people he said by the time universities traditionally dealt with pupils between the ages of 16 and 18 it was too late instead they should be reaching out to communities and schools much earlier even down to primary school level to persuade them a university education was something they could aspire to he said but while the report revealed stark inequalities and exposed the extent of the challenge there were some encouraging findings he added tuition fees and student loans in england and wales and the different fee regime in scotland did not seem to have affected the choices of young people even the poorest the report also showed women were 18 more likely than men to enter higher education in 2000 up from 6 in 1994 in the poorest areas the gap was 30 in women s favour and growing faster than anywhere else the higher education minister kim howells said we are working in schools to raise the attainment and aspiration of young people in disadvantaged areas higher standards in schools would lead to greater participation in higher education from 2006 upfront tuition fees in england would be removed with grants for the less well off the shadow education secretary tim collins said it is clear from this report that children from disadvantaged areas are far more likely to have encountered poor standards in their secondary education tackling these must be the top priority for any government looking to improve university access the group which represents university vice chancellors universities uk said the new system of deferred fees in england due to start in 2006 with grants and bursaries for poorer students would encourage more of them to go into higher education the national union of students argued the opposite that the situation was likely to get much worse with poorer students being restricted in choice and having to make decisions based on their financial situation rather than aspiration the tables below show the participation rate for each parliamentary constituency in britain

4,taxes must be trusted kennedy public trust in taxes is breaking down because labour and tories are not being straight with people on the issue lib dem leader charles kennedy has said a day ahead of the government s pre budget report mr kennedy used a speech to say his party was facing up to painful economic realities he said the current level of taxation was about right although he would put a new 50 tax on top earners other parties have accused the lib dems of making uncosted promises mr kennedy made it clear he was determined to counter that accusation the lib dems have already published what they say are the full costings for all their plans and wednesday s speech did not announce new policies speaking at the commonwealth club mr kennedy said it was critical for a political party to have economic credibility both on what it promised and what it was expected to deliver he said budgets have to add up tough choices are needed in public spending the lib dems would cut low priority spending including the government s id cards scheme and the child trust fund those cutbacks would free up funds for increasing basic state pensions for over 75s putting more police on the streets and reintroducing fee eye and dental checks he said the lib dems argue they were honest about taxes in the past by calling for a 1p rise on income tax now they say the only simple tax rise they want is a new 50 tax band for top earners to pay for scrapping university tuition fees providing free personal care for elderly and disabled people and keeping local taxes down there would also be a local income tax to replace council tax and a number of changes to environmental taxes to ensure it is the polluter who pays the lib dems say the tories have only laid out possible options for cutting taxes to grab headlines while labour has hidden most of its tax rises mr kennedy said that contract with the people that the government will only tax fairly and will spend their money wisely can only be sustained if the political parties are straightforward about their plans with the stealth tax strategy of gordon brown the obvious unfairness of our current tax system especially the council tax and the empty promises of the conservative party on this issue it is no wonder that trust in taxation is breaking down he challenged the treasury to open up its books so the national audit office can report on the government s performance conservative co chairman liam fox said liam fox said if charles kennedy is serious about making his budgets add up he should start by explaining how they would fund their 100 spending commitments the reality is the lib dems lack the courage to tackle waste and bureaucracy and the only people who would face tough choices would be the families who would be 630 worse off a year and chancellor gordon brown said the lib dem figures did not add up he accused the party of claiming it would spend less while across the country committing itself to spend more

3,music man to the oscars bill conti s job of musical director of the oscars show is not for the faint hearted since conducting the orchestra is the ultimate plate spinning assignment this year marks conti s 17th turn at the helm of the academy awards orchestra the excitement is a live performance as a musician he says all of your colleagues everyone in the film industry is in the theatre all the important people i guess it s just a television show but we always think it s a bit more the orchestra strikes up more than 110 times during the average oscars show as well as playing the presenters and winners on and off stage it also performs during the commercial breaks to entertain the live audience in the house it s a very busy evening it takes a certain amount of preparation of music orchestrating sketching rehearsing before the show but you don t know what the unexpected will be and as the musical director it s exciting explains conti and much of the preparation goes into mastering scores that will never be performed we don t know who the winners will be so when they say the winner is we have five different pieces of music in front of us they say the name we play the appropriate one immediately adds conti the orchestra is often called upon to play when the winners ramble on too long during their acceptance speeches despite being told to be brief by the show s producers the decision to drown out or kill the offending star with music is relayed from the director s box to the orchestra via conti s earpiece i don t feel good about it at all it s not my call though he says when the director says music the orchestra plays and he takes a long shot of the hall we don t usually see the person speaking while his microphone is cut off the person that s been cut off who s 10 feet from me is glaring at me like it s death time on occasions some stars have taken it upon themselves to send a warning shot across the bows of the musical director before they start to speak julia roberts when she came on she asked me to not get ready to play because she had so much to do he says conti received an oscar in 1983 for the original score of the right stuff he also received two nominations in the original song category in 1976 for gonna fly now from rocky and in 1981 for the title song from for your eyes only it s a moment in the sun he says when people get up there some people this is hard to believe people that spend their lives in front of the camera or audiences entertaining might get a little flustered but there s this moment in time when the biggest award that they could possibly get in their life has been handed to them and they re either not in control or they want to thank everyone that they ever met the image of the oscars telecast is one of slick presentation and smooth transitions between performances and the award categories behind the scenes the key players such as conti have a bewildering array of technical props to deal with there s a big script and video monitors you have to watch and there are also audio controls i can control hearing in my ears the left ear or the right ear different things at different times i have to communicate with the director i have a little microphone that s attached to my headset to open up that microphone i have a footswitch he explains conti s most nerve wracking moment came during his first oscars show as musical director in 1977 when a member of the orchestra alerted him that they could smell smoke conti immediately told the show s director i start cursing and screaming i tell him we re not going to die for this show you must do something or i m going to climb out of this pit with 60 musicians and we re going to be home in 10 minutes oh no bill don t do anything came the response imagine these elegantly dressed ladies and gentlemen of the orchestra 60 or so of them in the pit and while we re playing firemen with their helmets and their hatchets crawling among us trying to find the reason for the smoke the smell turned out to be new paint smouldering on the music stands no one died it s not a big story but it was scary at the time laughs conti when the ceremony is over the music director attends the annual governor s ball with his family i have a drink and relive the show he says i m not for too much carousing i go home and unwind it takes me about a day

1,business fears over sluggish eu economy as european leaders gather in rome on friday to sign the new eu constitution many companies will be focusing on matters much closer to home namely how to stay in business lille is a popular tourist destination for britons who want a taste of france at the weekend but how many tourists look at the impressively grand victorian chambre de commerce which stands beside the opera house and consider that it was built like the town halls in many northern english towns on the wealth created by coal steel and textiles like northern england and industrial scotland those industries have been in long term decline the last coal pit closed in 1990 beck crespel is a specialist steel firm in armentieres about 20 miles from lille the company has not laid off a worker since 1945 it specialises in making bolts and fixings for power stations and the oil industry but not many of those are being built in europe these days director hugues charbonnier says he is under pressure because factories in the far east are able to make some of his output more cheaply while his key markets are now in china and india in our business the market is absolutely global you can not imagine living with our size of business even within an enlarged european union if we did that we would need not 350 people but perhaps just 150 or 200 he says it isn t just globalisation that is hurting the law in france means workers are paid for a 39 hour week even though they work just 35 hours but at least there is still a steel industry coal has now totally vanished and textiles are struggling new business has been attracted but not enough to make up the difference that is one reason why people here are not great fans of the eu says frederic sawicki a politics lecturer at the university of lille in the region today the unemployment rate is 12 in some areas it is 15 they don t see what europe is doing for them so there is a kind of euro scepticism especially in the working classes he says which is strange because lille is at the crossroads of europe if anywhere should be benefiting from the euro it is here the euro was designed to increase trade within the eurozone but the biggest increase in trade has been with the rest of the world much of that trade passes through the world s largest port rotterdam in holland home to specialist crane maker huisman itrec its cranes help build oil rigs and lifted the sunken russian submarine kursk from the sea bed but huisman itrec is now setting up a factory in china where costs are cheaper and its main customers are closer boss henk addink blames the low growth rate in europe for the lack of orders closer to home in the us growth is something like 6 in china they are estimating 15 and in the eu it is more or less 1 he says mr addink blames the euro for stifling demand he much preferred the old currencies of europe which moved in relation to each country s economic performance in germany industry is exporting more these days but the economy as a whole is once again mired in slow growth and high unemployment growth is likely to peak this year at just under 2 in britain that would be a bad year in germany it is one of the best in recent years with germany making up a third of the eurozone s economy this is a major problem if germany doesn t once again become the powerhouse of europe growth across the bloc is never going to be as strong as it could be however at one factory near the dutch border things are changing the siemens plant at boscholt makes cordless phones and employs 2 000 staff staff have started working an extra four hours a week for no extra pay after siemens threatened to take the factory and their jobs to hungary factory manager herbert stueker says that he now hopes to increase productivity by nearly 30 but germany needs much more reform if all its industry is to compete with places such hungary or china the government is reforming the labour market and cutting the generous unemployment system but the real solution is to cut the wages of low skilled workers says helmut schneider director of the institute for the study of labour at bonn university labour is too costly in germany especially for the low skilled labour and this is the main problem if we could solve that problem we could cut unemployment by half he says the eu set itself the target of being the most efficient economy in the world by 2010 four years into that process and the target seems further away than ever

4,muslims discuss election concerns issues that muslims should be considering before voting in the next general election are to be debated by uk community representatives the event is being held by the muslim association of britain mab which believes muslim voters could influence the result in up to 50 constituencies last year mab which opposed the war in iraq urged muslims not to vote for labour in the european elections but a spokesman stressed the meeting was not necessarily anti labour this meeting is not anti party in particular it s anti policy it s on the issues we are going to ask muslims to vote on mab spokesman dr azzam tamimi said of tuesday s event there are issues of concern to muslims and muslims generally agree on them but have not in the past been aware of how a vote can serve these issues dr tamimi said the main issues muslims should consider were what he referred to as the war on iraq the palestinian situation the erosion of civil liberties for muslims in the uk and economic social and education problems approximately 1 1m of the uk s 1 6m muslims are of voting age previous election research has shown the overwhelming majority have traditionally voted labour but more recent studies have suggested labour support has been falling away significantly among some muslim voters anger over the war in iraq has appeared to be the main reason with many saying it was unjustified representatives from a number of muslim organisations will attend tuesday s event among them will be the muslim council of britain mcb the chairman of the mcb s public affairs committee sher khan said the war in iraq would be a significant factor affecting muslims voting intentions i think it s going to be quite significant because of the number of seats in which they could have an impact mr khan said however professor john curtice of the university of strathclyde is sceptical about how much difference tactical voting by muslims could make for the most part the labour constituencies where there s a large muslim community are relatively safe but there are one or two that are not quite so safe professor curtice said the constituencies where labour was most at risk from a muslim tactical vote were bethnal green in east london and rochdale in lancashire he added in bethnal green former labour mp george galloway who founded the anti war party respect is standing against sitting mp oona king who had a 10 000 vote majority in 2001 in rochdale the liberal democrats the mainstream party a 2004 icm survey showed was benefiting most from muslim disaffection with labour secured second place in the 2001 election securing just under 6 000 votes fewer than labour s lorna fitzsimons but professor curtice said the muslim anti war vote could be split between the liberal democrats and respect meaning neither would benefit much at the ballot box ironically the tories might be the beneficiaries if labour does lose seats which is generally the case he said but dr tamimi said mab s intention was not to empower the tories we know the next government will be labour but we are aiming to send a message that it will make a difference if the muslims use their vote properly if the next labour government has a reduced majority that s a great achievement because having a very big majority has been very harmful for politics in this country dr tamimi said

3,us afflicted with awards fatigue the film world and media may be wild about the oscars but cinema goers and the tv viewing public are sick of watching award ceremonies according to some la film critics bob strauss from the la daily news thinks there are just too many televised gatherings of stars showering praise on each other he came up with a colourful but unprintable description for these glitzy events which roughly translates a celebrity love in this echoed the views of oscars host and comedian chris rock who whipped up a media storm for saying he rarely watched them calling award shows idiotic as chris rock accurately said they re about celebrity and fashion mr strauss said the recent grammy music awards proved to be a ratings loser and it seems oscars organisers are determined not to go the same way recently announced changes to the ceremony include lining up all five nominees on stage before announcing the winner unsurprisingly this prompted press speculation that the changes were aimed at boosting flagging advertising revenue but entertainment weekly s dave karger maintained the oscars only generated excitement outside the industry when a blockbuster such as titanic or lord of the rings was nominated the near constant flow of us film awards representing directors actors and producers guilds also means few surprises are left by the time the oscar ceremony is upon us he said a quick scan of the los angeles times and los angeles daily news bears this out speculation about who will win seems to have ground to a halt on thursday the times simply printed a picture of the plastic tents going up outside the kodak theatre to protect the red carpet from rain variety and the hollywood reporter have also kept their focus firmly on industry related news while in the uk bets have closed on the best actor category with ray star jamie foxx a dead cert to win screen international s us editor mike goodridge thinks 2004 s films have simply not grabbed the public s imagination film makers haven t produced films that people adore this year he said they adored saving private ryan for example people loved it and it made a ton of money 2004 s films could be a reaction to 9 11 there was a realisation in america that things might not be so rosy after all audiences don t necessarily want to see darker films such as million dollar baby aviator and finding neverland which end with casualty as to whether rock could pep up the awards the critics were not hopeful mr strauss doubted whether rock would make an impact but added i m all for lower ratings though there are far more important things going on than the oscars mr karger said the comic might boost younger viewers but mike goodridge thought rock s humour could prompt america s conservative states to switch off so despite all this did the critics have any views on who would win clint eastwood s million dollar baby affected people emotionally which is why it will beat aviator which was about technical artistry not feelings mr karger said eastwood has it in the bag added mr strauss oscar voters often vote with their hearts not their heads and mr goodridge said best film and director were between martin scorsese s aviator and million dollar baby mr karger whose favourite film of the year was mike leigh s abortion drama vera drake stayed upbeat about the awards despite his other comments i hope this is the year for small films to triumph he said after all it s still one of the biggest tv events of the year

3,u2 s desire to be number one u2 who have won three prestigious grammy awards for their hit vertigo are stubbornly clinging to their status as one of the biggest bands in the world the most popular groups in the history of rock all have several things in common the music must be inspired and appeal across generations and be distinctive if not always groundbreaking but such success is down to more than music they have to be compelling performers charismatic and intelligent enough to make good decisions and keep their feet on the ground they also have to want it they have to want to be the biggest band ever and not stop wanting it the beatles had it the rolling stones still have it rem hold onto it and queen were it in a catsuit and u2 have it in spades and keep churning it out their new album how to dismantle an atomic bomb comes 28 years after the schoolfriends got together in dublin and 17 years after the joshua tree cemented their place on the all time rock a list they may have lost some of the edginess and raw youthful force that propelled them to the top but they have lost none of the desire or ability to craft songs and albums vertigo the first single from the new album went straight into the uk singles chart at number one knocking eminem off the top spot and giving them their 26th top 10 hit the challenge is to be bigger and bolder and better to make records the whole world will listen to bono recently said drummer larry mullen jr echoed those sentiments we re very competitive we want to be on the radio have big singles we don t want to be thought of as a veteran band the band have done everything in their considerable powers to ensure they remain the biggest band in the world according to q magazine editor paul rees this makes them hugely determined and formidable he added they are equally determined to push themselves to make music that continues to stand up as such they ve constantly re invented and challenged themselves they are perhaps alone as the only rock band that has got better with age the other key ingredient was the fact they were highly organised mr rees said they do everything in the right way the group were born when mullen put an appeal for bandmates on a high school notice board attracting fellow pupils paul hewson bono vocals adam clayton bass david evans the edge guitar and his brother dick dick evans soon dropped out and the four piece were known as the feedback and the hype before settling on u2 by 1978 they had won a talent contest and got noticed by a manager paul mcguinness they were brilliant but very coarse mcguinness recently said in a way they were doing exactly what they do now only badly they struggled to attract record company attention later being described as pretty damn average and strange and eerie by scouts who saw them live they released two ireland only singles which topped the national charts in 1979 and 1980 leading to a deal with island and their debut album boy the stadium filling anthemic sound was u2 s aim from the start and their third album war saw them make the breakthrough on both sides of the atlantic going to number one in the uk and 12 in the us songs like sunday bloody sunday and new year s day brought success and an image as a political and spiritual band which bono rejected as a cliche his stage performances which included flag waving speaker climbing and drum throwing earned him a reputation as an electric performer and their appearance at 1985 s live aid is widely seen as sealing their global stardom in 1987 the joshua tree broke sales records and saw the band reach the height of their powers with hits including where the streets have no name i still haven t found what i m looking for and with or without you those songs took the band s epic atmospheric sound to a simple powerful and popular pinnacle the end of the decade marked a crucial point for the band they had reached the top but still yearned for new challenges and achievements these came in the form of explorations of different branches of rock and forays into electronic dance music plus wildly extravagant stage shows while still trying to retain their mass appeal the achtung baby album in 1991 was followed by zooropa pop and their corresponding stadium tours which featured giant olives flying cars live phone calls to the white house and bono s transformation into alter egos the fly and macphisto he was also building a parallel reputation not always to the pleasure of his bandmates as a campaigner on issues from global debt to aids before the release of how to dismantle an atomic bomb they had sold 125 million albums around the world but they still want more

0,concerns over windows atms cash machine networks could soon be more susceptible to computer viruses a security firm has warned the warning is being issued because many banks are starting to use the windows operating system in machines already there have been four incidents in which windows viruses have disrupted networks of cash machines running the microsoft operating system but banking experts say the danger is being overplayed and that the risks of infection and disruption are small for many years the venerable ibm operating system known as os 2 has been the staple software used to power many of the 1 4m cash machines in operation around the world but ibm will end support for os 2 in 2006 which is forcing banks to look for alternatives there are also other pressures making banks turn to windows said dominic hirsch managing director of financial analysis firm retail banking research he said many cash machines will also have to be upgraded to make full use of the new europay mastercard and visa credit cards that use computer chips instead of magnetic stripes to store data us laws that demand disabled people get equal access to information will also force banks to make their cash machines more versatile and able to present information in different ways todd thiemann spokesman for anti virus firm trend micro said the move to windows in cash machines was not without risks mr thiemann said research by the towergroup showed that 70 of new cash machines being installed were windows based already he said there have been four incidents in which cash machines have been unavailable for hours due to viruses affecting the network of the bank that owns them in january 2003 the slammer worm knocked out 13 000 cash machines of the bank of america and many of those operated by the canadian imperial bank of commerce in august of the same year cash machines of two un named banks were put out of action for hours following an infection by the welchia worm incidents like this happen said mr thiemann because when banks start using windows cash machines they also change the networking technology used to link the devices to their back office computers this often means that all the cash machines and computers in a bank share the same data network this could mean that cash machines get caught up in the viruses that are going around because they have a common transmission system he said banks need to consider protection as part of the investment to maintain the security of that network mr thiemann told bbc news online but mr hirsch from retail banking research said the number of cash machines actually at risk was low because so few were upgraded every year currently he said a cash machine has a lifetime of up to 10 years which means that only about 10 of all atms get swapped for a newer model every year windows cash machines have been around for several years he said most banks simply upgrade as part of their usual replacement cycle in theory there is a bigger threat with windows than os 2 he said but i do not think that the banks are hugely concerned at the moment it s pretty unusual to hear about virus problems with atms he said the many different security systems built in to cash machines meant there was no chance that a virus could cause them to start spitting out cash spontaneously he said banks were more likely to be worried about internal networks being overwhelmed by worms and viruses and customers not being able to get cash out at all he added a spokesman for the association of payment and clearing services apacs which represents the uk s payments industry said the risk from viruses was minimal there s no concern that there s going to be any type of virus hitting the uk networks he said risks of infection were small because the data networks that connect uk cash machines together and the operators of the atms themselves were a much smaller and tightly knit community than in the us where viruses have struck
0,blog reading explodes in america americans are becoming avid blog readers with 32 million getting hooked in 2004 according to new research the survey conducted by the pew internet and american life project showed that blog readership has shot up by 58 in the last year some of this growth is attributable to political blogs written and read during the us presidential campaign despite the explosive growth more than 60 of online americans have still never heard of blogs the survey found blogs or web logs are online spaces in which people can publish their thoughts opinions or spread news events in their own words companies such as google and microsoft provide users with the tools to publish their own blogs the rise of blogs has spawned a new desire for immediate news and information with six million americans now using rss aggregators rss aggregators are downloaded to pcs and are programmed to subscribe to feeds from blogs news sites and other websites the aggregators automatically compile the latest information published online from the blogs or news sites reading blogs remains far more popular than writing them the survey found only 7 of the 120 million us adults who use the internet had created a blog or web based diary getting involved is becoming more popular though with 12 saying they had posted material or comments on other people s blogs just under one in 10 of the us s internet users read political blogs such as the daily kos or instapundit during the us presidential campaign kerry voters were slightly more likely to read them than bush voters blog creators were likely to be young well educated net savvy males with good incomes and college educations the survey found this was also true of the average blog reader although the survey found there was a greater than average growth in blog readership among women and those in minorities the survey was conducted during november and involved telephone surveys of 1 324 internet users
0,lifestyle governs mobile choice faster better or funkier hardware alone is not going to help phone firms sell more handsets research suggests instead phone firms keen to get more out of their customers should not just be pushing the technology for its own sake consumers are far more interested in how handsets fit in with their lifestyle than they are in screen size onboard memory or the chip inside shows an in depth study by handset maker ericsson historically in the industry there has been too much focus on using technology said dr michael bjorn senior advisor on mobile media at ericsson s consumer and enterprise lab we have to stop saying that these technologies will change their lives he said we should try to speak to consumers in their own language and help them see how it fits in with what they are doing he told the bbc news website for the study ericsson interviewed 14 000 mobile phone owners on the ways they use their phone people s habits remain the same said dr bjorn they just move the activity into the mobile phone as it s a much more convenient way to do it one good example of this was diary writing among younger people he said while diaries have always been popular a mobile phone especially one equipped with a camera helps them keep it in a different form youngsters use of text messages also reflects their desire to chat and keep in contact with friends and again just lets them do it in a slightly changed way dr bjorn said that although consumers do what they always did but use a phone to do it the sheer variety of what the new handset technologies make possible does gradually drive new habits and lifestyles ericsson s research has shown that consumers divide into different tribes that use phones in different ways dr bjorn said groups dubbed pioneers and materialists were most interested in trying new things and were behind the start of many trends in phone use for instance he said older people are using sms much more than they did five years ago this was because younger users often the children of ageing mobile owners encouraged older people to try it so they could keep in touch another factor governing the speed of change in mobile phone use was the simple speed with which new devices are bought by pioneers and materialists only when about 25 of people have handsets with new innovations on them such as cameras can consumers stop worrying that if they send a picture message the person at the other end will be able to see it once this significant number of users is passed use of new innovations tends to take off dr bjorn said that early reports of camera phone usage in japan seemed to imply that the innovation was going to be a flop however he said now 45 of the japanese people ericsson questioned use their camera phone at least once a month in 2003 the figure was 29 similarly across europe the numbers of people taking snaps with cameras is starting to rise in 2003 only 4 of the people in the uk took a phonecam snap at least once a month now the figure is 14 similar rises have been seen in many other european nations dr bjorn said that people also used their camera phones in very different ways to film and even digital cameras usage patterns for digital cameras are almost exactly replacing usage patterns for analogue cameras he said digital cameras tend to be used on significant events such as weddings holidays and birthdays by contrast he said camera phones were being used much more to capture a moment and were being woven into everyday life

0,file swappers ready new network legal attacks on websites that help people swap pirated films have forced the development of a system that could be harder to shut down one site behind the success of the bittorrent file swapping system is producing its own software that avoids the pitfalls of the earlier program a test version of the new exeem program will be released in late january but doubts remain about the new networks ability to ensure files being swapped are quality copies in late december movie studios launched a legal campaign against websites that helped people swap pirated movies using the bittorrent network the legal campaign worked because of the way that bittorrent is organised that file sharing system relies on links called trackers that point users to others happy to share the file they are looking for shutting down sites that listed trackers crippled the bittorrent network one of the sites shut down by the legal campaign was suprnova org which helped boost the popularity of the bittorrent system by checking that trackers led to the movies or tv programmes they claimed to now the man behind suprnova org who goes by the nickname sloncek is preparing to release software for a new file swapping network dubbed exeem in an interview with novastream web radio sloncek said exeem would combine ideas from the bittorrent and kazaa file sharing systems like bittorrent exeem will have trackers that help point people toward the file they want like kazaa these trackers will be held by everyone there will be no centrally maintained list this said sloncek should make the system less vulnerable to legal action aimed at stopping people swapping pirated movies and music the exeem software has been under development for a few months and is currently being tested by a closed group of users an early public version of the software should be available before february sloncek said that currently only a windows version of the software was in development there were no plans for a linux or mac version he said that costs of writing the software will be paid for by adverts appearing in the finished version of the program despite suprnova administrator sloncek s involvement with exeem the basic technology appears to have been developed by a firm called swarm systems that is based on caribbean island saint kitts and nevis users of the exeem system will be able to rate files being swapped to help stop the spread of fake files sloncek told novastream dr johan pouwelse a researcher at the delft university of technology who studies peer to peer networks said exeem was the next evolution in file sharing systems but he said it would struggle to be as popular as bittorrent and suprnova because early versions were not taking enough care to make sure good copies of files were being shared exeem cannot prevent pollution he said the rating system in exeem seems flawed because it is easy to insert both fake files and fake ratings he said studies have shown that organisations working for record labels and movie studios have worked to undermine kazaa by putting in fakes by contrast moderators on suprnova made sure files being shared were high quality the moderators are the difference between having a system that works and one that s full of crap like kazaa he said there is a fundamental tension between distribution and integrity he said mr pouwelse said that future versions of file sharing systems are likely to incorporate some kind of distributed reputation system that lets moderators prove who they are to the network and rate which files are worth downloading when big files were being shared moderation systems were key said mr pouwelse he added that the legal attacks on bittorrent had driven people away from sites such as suprnova but many users had simply migrated to other tracker listing sites many of which have seen huge increases in traffic it s hard to compete with free he said no one from the motion picture association of america was immediately available for comment on the file sharing development

0,musical future for phones analyst bill thompson has seen the future and it is in his son s hands i bought my son max a 3g phone partly because they are so cheap and he needed a phone and partly because i am supposed to know about the latest technology and thought i should see how they work in real life after using it for a while i am not at all tempted to get rid of my sonyericsson p800 smart phone that has a relatively large screen even if it does only have slower gprs access to the network i can read my e mail surf the web using a proper browser and write stuff using the stylus on its touch screen last week someone e mailed me a document that had been compressed into a zip file and i was pleasantly surprised to discover that my phone even knew how to decompress it for me by contrast the confusing menus complicated keyboard and truly irritating user interface of max s 3g phone simply get in the way and i did not see much value in the paid for services especially the limited web access the videos of entertainment news horoscopes and the latest celebrity gossip did not appeal and i did not see how the small screen could be useful for any sort of image never mind micro tv but then max started playing and i realised i was missing the point entirely it is certainly not a great overall experience but that is largely due to the poor menu system and the phone layout the video content itself is compelling the quality was at least as good as the video streaming from the bbc website and the image is about the same size max was completely captivated and i was intrigued to discover that i had nearly missed the next stage of the network revolution it is easy to be dismissive of small screens and indeed anyone of my generation with failing eyesight and the view that there s never anything worth watching on tv is hardly going to embrace these phones but just as the world wide web was the killer application that drove internet adoption music videos are going to drive 3g adoption with vodafone now pushing its own 3g service and 3 already established in the uk video on the phone is clearly going to become a must have for kids sitting on the school bus adults waiting outside clubs and anyone who has time to kill and a group of friends to impress this will please the network operators who are looking for some revenue from their expensively acquired 3g licences but it goes deeper than that playing music videos on a phone marks the beginning of a move away from the download and play model we have all accepted for our ipods and mp3 players after all why should i want to carry 60gb of music and pictures around with me in my pocket when i can simply listen to anything i want whenever i want streamed to my phone oh and of course you can always use the phone to make voice calls and send texts something which ensures that it is always in someone s pocket or handbag available for other uses too i have never really approved of using the internet protocol ip to do either audio or video streaming and i think that technically it is a disaster to make phone calls over the net using voice over ip but i have to acknowledge that the net at least here in the developed western countries is fast and reliable enough to do both i stream radio to my computer while i work and enjoy hearing the bizarre stations from around the world that i can find online but nowhere else i am even playing with internet telephony despite my reservations and i appear on go digital on the world service streamed over the web each week but 3g networks have been designed to do this sort of streaming both for voice and video which gives them an edge over net based ip services the 3g services aren t quite there yet and there is a lot to be sorted out when it comes to web access and data charges vodafone will let you access its services on vodafone live as part of your subscription cost but it makes you pay by the megabyte to download from other sites this one for example this will not matter to business users but will distort the consumer market and keep people within the phone company s collection of partner sites something that should perhaps be worrying telecoms regulator ofcom but we should not see these new phones simply as cut down network terminals if i want fast access to my e mail i can get a 3g card for my laptop or hook up to a wireless network the phone is a lot more and it is as a combination of mini tv personal communications device and music video player that it really works there is certainly room in the technology ecosystem for many different sorts of devices accessing a wide range of services over different networks 3g phones and ipods can co exist at least for a while but if i had to bet on the long term i would go for content on demand over carrying gigabytes in my pocket or perhaps some enterprising manufacturer will offer me both an mp3g player anyone bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital

1,golden rule boost for chancellor chancellor gordon brown has been given a 2 1bn boost in his attempts to meet his golden economic rule which allows him to borrow only for investment the extra leeway came after the office for national statistics said it had been measuring road expenditure data wrongly over the past five years it comes just weeks ahead of the budget and an expected general election shadow chancellor oliver letwin said at best the timing of these changes is very convenient for the government a review by the ons found it had made a mistake by double counting some spending on roads since 1998 9 correcting the error would mean reducing current expenditure and increasing net investment thus helping mr brown to meet his golden rule of borrowing only to invest over the economic cycle economists speculated that it might also allow for some vote catching measures in the budget the changes by the ons increase the current budget measure for the past five years by 2 1bn in total mr letwin said this is a very murky area there will inevitably be suspicions that the figures are being fiddled the conservatives also said mr brown would still be forced to raise taxes after the general election to fill an annual 10 5bn black hole in the nation s coffers but the treasury said there would be no relaxation of economic discipline and the golden rule would be met even without the data revisions in january the independent institute for fiscal studies ifs said mr brown would need to raise taxes to get public finances onto the track predicted in last year s budget it also said the government might narrowly miss its golden rule if the current economic cycle ended in 2005 06 after the ons announcement economists said there could also be a proportionate boost to the current budget in 2004 05 of about 400m none of this changes the big picture of a dramatic deterioration in the overall fiscal position over the last four or five years said jonathan loynes chief uk economist at capital economics accordingly it seems very likely that some form of fiscal consolidation will be required in due course

4,howard s unfinished business he s not finished yet whispered the conservative party person as your reporter attempted to slip quietly from the hall and indeed he wasn t michael howard had already broken away from the printed text of his speech at his party s spring conference in brighton to deliver a smart rebuff to peter hain s description of him as an attack mongrel claiming such personal abuse meant labour was rattled by the tory challenge and here he was again moving to the front of the stage as the party faithful rose to their feet in applause to make a personal ad libbed appeal to them to go out and fight for victory one day you will be able to tell your children and grandchildren as i will tell mine i was there i did my bit i played my part i helped to win that famous election the election that transformed our country for the better the speech which was peppered with references to mr howard s humble beginnings as the child of immigrants had been introduced by his son nick a trainee vicar who praised his father s honesty i always know where i am with him because all my life he has meant what he has said to me he said mr howard was also joined on stage by his wife sandra daughter larissa and stepson sholto the audience s reaction to all of this was a little muted by party conference standards but mr howard s overall message that the tories have labour on the run and that they can win the next election did not sound quite as hollow as it might have done six months ago mr howard claimed with some justification that the tories campaign has got off to a great start they have had labour on the back foot over immigration with tony blair hastily adding a sixth promise on the issue to his latest pledge card and have even managed to score points in traditional labour territory such as health and education the stunts involving margaret dixon with her postponed operation and maria hutchings with concerns about her son s special needs education may not have been to everyone s taste but they succeeded in bringing the issues alive and forcing labour to react senior tories believe they are at long last starting to tap into the public mood cutting through the background noise to connect with the ordinary voter their latest poster campaign flags up a range of policies from better school discipline cleaner hospitals i mean how hard is it to keep a hospital clean and immigration it s not racist to impose limits on immigration under the headline are you thinking what we are thinking this they say contrasts with labour s negative campaigning such as its now infamous flying pigs poster oliver letwin one of the men lampooned in the labour poster affects bewilderment at what he believes is labour s loss of its once sure footing on the campaign trail the peter hain mongrel attack he says is just the latest example of the party getting the tone wrong a by product he claims of the tories setting the agenda i have to say i don t understand what they are doing the labour machine appears to be in some kind of state of shock it doesn t seem to know what to do a few weeks of positive headlines have also done wonders for tory activists morale likely to be a crucial factor at an election which most analysts seem to agree will hinge on which party can get their core support out it has been a fantastic few weeks said 20 year old politics student nick vaughan our policies have been getting in the media and there is a sense that we can win i wouldn t be here if i didn t think we could some delegates even spoke of the next election being like 1970 when ted heath behind in the polls and written off by the pundits snatched victory from harold wilson s labour party they all insisted it was not going to be a re run of 2001 we thought in 2001 we were going to dent that massive majority but it just didn t happen said john murray of aldridge browhills conservatives it was very disappointing this time it really is different whoever is running our strategy from the top has got it bang on blair is on the back foot much of the credit for the tories recent change of fortune must go to lynton crosby the australian strategist who succeeded in turning political veteran and apparent no hoper john howard of australia s liberal party into a serial election winner the tories still have a mountain climb if michael howard is to walk through the doors of number 10 even allowing for the natural bias against the tories in some opinion polls they are still behind when to have a chance of overturning labour s whopping majority they should really be ahead but as they gear up for the start of the campaign proper the party at least has reason to hope that like his australian namesake mr howard really isn t finished yet

4,new rules tackle sham weddings new rules on marriage for foreign nationals living in the uk are coming into force from tuesday most non eu citizens will need home office approval to marry the home office says the new rules are aimed at reducing the number of sham marriages of which there are estimated to be up to 15 000 a year but immigrants group the joint council for the welfare of immigrants jcwi says the rules breach human rights law and it may mount a legal challenge when the changes were unveiled last year immigration minister des browne said our aim is to avoid unnecessary disruption of genuine marriages while providing firm controls to prevent abuse under the previous regulations anybody wishing to get married in the uk only had to produce evidence they had been resident in the country for a week and give 15 days notice of the wedding at the local register office but from tuesday all non eu nationals apart from citizens of switzerland liechtenstein iceland or norway intending to wed in the uk must either obtain a visa allowing them to get married before they enter the country or apply for a home office certificate of marriage approval to get a certificate costing 135 applicants will have to send proof that they have a legal right to be in the uk those without a settled status such as asylum seekers awaiting a decision on their application will have no right to marry in the uk once they have the necessary documentation those subject to immigration controls wishing to get married in england or wales must register their intention to marry at one of 76 specially designated register offices they can however marry at the register office or church of their choice rhian beynon of the jcwi said the new rules were not proportionate and discriminatory these rules means in some cases the home secretary is going to be a marriage registrar of last resort we re currently taking a legal opinion on this we ll be looking for people whose right to marry is breached and we ll be looking at taking a case on this to the human rights court ms beynon said the new rules have also been called into question by the parliamentary joint committee on human rights in a report published last july the cross party committee stated there was a significant risk the new procedures were incompatible with the right to marry because they introduced restrictions which were disproportionate the committee believed the new laws might be incompatible with the human rights act on the grounds of religion belief and nationality the report added over the last year immigration service operations against marriages of convenience have been stepped up resulting in a growing number of convictions in january 25 people who took part in a sham marriage network based in leicester were jailed for a total of 35 years and last november samuel amoah a belgian national who set up two sham weddings for couples who wanted to remain in the uk was jailed for three years several other cases are currently going through the courts the role of registrars who under the asylum and immigration act 1999 were obliged to report suspected sham marriages to the home office has been key in many prosecutions registrars spokesman mark rimmer said they welcomed the new marriage regulations and believed they would be an significant deterrent they will effectively remove most of the blatant cases certainly those who are illegals in this country of which we had quite a few will no longer be getting married mr rimmer said mr rimmer the service director for registrations of marriages at brent council in north west london said he did not consider the new law to be an infringement of civil liberties it may be seen to be far more draconian than it has been but certainly it s still not as difficult to marry in the uk than it is to marry for example in holland germany or france i think it s a proportionate response by government to what was a very large problem mr rimmer said
0,looks and music to drive mobiles mobile phones are still enjoying a boom time in sales according to research from technology analysts gartner more than 674 million mobiles were sold last year globally said the report the highest total sold to date the figure was 30 more than in 2003 and surpassed even the most optimistic predictions gartner said good design and the look of a mobile as well as new services such as music downloads could go some way to pushing up sales in 2005 said analysts although people were still looking for better replacement phones there was evidence according to gartner that some markets were seeing a slow down in replacement sales all the markets grew apart from japan which shows that replacement sales are continuing in western europe mobile analyst carolina milanesi told the bbc news website japan is where north america and western european markets can be in a couple of years time they already have tv music ringtones cameras and all that we can think of on mobiles so people have stopped buying replacement phones but there could be a slight slowdown in sales in european and us markets too according to gartner as people wait to see what comes next in mobile technology this means mobile companies have to think carefully about what they are offering in new models so that people see a compelling reason to upgrade said gartner third generation mobiles 3g with the ability to handle large amounts of data transfer like video could drive people into upgrading their phones but ms milanesi said it was difficult to say how quickly that would happen at the end of the day people have cameras and colour screens on mobiles and for the majority of people out there who don t really care about technology the speed of data to a phone is not critical nor would the rush to produce two or three megapixel camera phones be a reason for mobile owners to upgrade on its own the majority of camera phone models are not at the stage where they can compete with digital cameras which also have flashes and zooms more likely to drive sales in 2005 would be the attention to design and aesthetics as well as music services the motorola razr v3 phone was typical of the attention to design that would be more commonplace in 2005 she added this was not a women s thing she said but a desire from men and women to have a gadget that is a form of self expression too it was not just about how the phone functioned but about what it said about its owner western europe has always been a market which is quite attentive to design said ms milanesi people are after something that is nice looking and together with that there is the entertainment side this year music will have a part to play in this the market for full track music downloads was worth just 20 million 10 5 million in 2004 but is set to be worth 1 8 billion 94 million by 2009 according to juniper research sony ericsson just released its walkman branded mobile phone the w800 which combines a digital music player with up to 30 hours battery life and a two megapixel camera in july last year motorola and apple announced a version of itunes online music downloading service would be released which would be compatible with motorola mobile phones apple said the new itunes music player would become motorola s standard music application for its music phones but the challenge will be balancing storage capacity with battery life if mobile music hopes to compete with digital music players like the ipod ms milanesi said more models would likely be released in the coming year with hard drives but they would be more likely to compete with the smaller capacity music players that have around four gigabyte storage capacity which would not put too much strain on battery life

4,campaign cold calls questioned labour and the conservatives are still telephoning the millions of people who have signed up to make sure they do not get marketing cold calls the parties say they can stick to the rules by ensuring that their calls are not marketing for instance by asking about people s voting intentions the lib dems are asking the watchdog overseeing the rules to stop the calls the information commissioner s office says surveys are allowed but there is a grey area if personal data is kept telephone call centres are expected to be used as never before by all the three major parties in the run up to the general election but seven million telephone numbers are on the telephone preference service tps lists which ban unsolicited sales and marketing calls both schemes are run by the direct marketing association and backed by eu directives on privacy and electronic communications the rules on marketing calls apply as much to politicians as to private sector companies but that does not mean labour and the tories are not calling people signed up to the tps a labour party spokesman told the bbc news website the party avoided those on tps lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising but that did not happen for voter identification calls when we ask which party they will vote for that is not marketing and we have very clear legal advice that it is not he said so it is not covered by the telephone preference service he said the party always asked people if they would be happy to be contacted again and if they said no they were not rung again a conservative spokeswoman said the party stuck to the rules when it rang tps subscribers she said we do apply tps but in line with the law we would not do things that are not allowed in the law a spokesman for the information commissioner s office said it would be classed as marketing if political parties telephoned people to encourage them to vote for them but the rules did allow polling organisations to telephone people about their voting intentions if they recorded them only as part of a bigger set of statistics not person by person if a political party was doing that than it may be that also would not be marketing he said the spokesman said it might be considered unsolicited marketing if a party recorded voting preferences with a view to marketing information in the future the spokesman said there was no yes or no answer and the area was pretty grey he added if someone complained then we would investigate that political parties are aware of the regulations at the last by elections we reminded them lib dem chairman matthew taylor has now written to the watchdog saying the advice we have received on several previous occasions is that such phone calls are illegal he says evidence from local lib dem parties around the country suggests there are significant numbers of such calls i hope you can therefore take swift and efficient action to ensure that this ceases he tells the commissioner mr taylor argues there should be new guidelines so all parties can act in the same way if the watchdog believes the rules allow parties to ring tps numbers about voting intentions and later urge those people to vote for them
