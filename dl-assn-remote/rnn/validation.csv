1,ukraine strikes turkmen gas deal ukraine has agreed to pay 30 more for natural gas supplied by turkmenistan the deal was sealed three days after turkmenistan cut off gas supplies in a price dispute that threatened the ukrainian economy supplies from turkmenistan account for 45 of all natural gas imported by ukraine which has large coal deposits but no gas fields turkmenistan is also trying to strike a similar deal with russia which is not so dependent on its gas turkmen president saparmurat niyazov who signed the contract said the turkmen side agreed to lower the price demanded by 2 per 1 000 cubic metres bringing it down to 58 but the new price is still 14 higher than the price fixed in the contract for 2004 the head of the ukrainian state owned naftohaz company yury boyko said he was fully happy with the deal on friday turkmenistan acted on a threat and shut off gas supplies to ukraine in attempt to bring the price dispute to a head mr niyazov said that his government would insist on the same price for supplies to russia analysts say thay may not happen as russia the world s leading gas producer needs the cheap turkmen gas only to relieve is state owned gazprom from costly investment in the exploration of oil fields in siberia turkmenistan is the second largest gas producer in the world
4,ukip s secret weapon by any measure new yorker dick morris is that thing americans love over everything else a winner this is the man who some pundits believe was almost single handedly responsible for bill clinton s sensational 1992 comeback victory but morris is no ideologue he has worked as election strategist for any number of republicans as well and more recently politicians from mexico to uruguay now he is back in london as the uk independence party s not so secret electoral weapon after returning from the ukraine where he helped you guessed it opposition candidate viktor yushchenko if there is one regular criticism levelled at morris it is that he is too ready to switch allegiances that he enjoys the game more than the politics so why britain and why ukip which despite its recent eu election successes is not likely to pull off a sensational victory in the looming general election on this subject morris appears almost evangelical i was on a cruise in the mediterranean and coincidentally so was ukip leader roger knapman i had just written a piece saying how the english channel was now wider than the atlantic which he liked and it went from there but what is it about ukip that particularly attracts him many might think it is simply another chance to practice his art irrespective of the politics i think the greatest threat to democracy in the world is not terrorism but bureaucratism a great soundbite but a surprise coming from a new yorker post 11 september it is the growth of these bodies composed of experts who know better who don t believe in letting democracy govern but believe in letting the correct solution be determined that s international bankers the world trade organisation the international monetary fund the world bank and primarily the european union so he is out to help ukip take britain out of this organisation which he believes is unreformable and inherently undemocratic and he is scathing of the tory party which he also appears to believe is unreformable the tory party is schizophrenic about europe but until somebody says they are willing to leave the eu they can t possibly re negotiate anything as michael howard is pledged to do it s like walking into a liquor store with a gun to rob it and saying before i can proceed with the robbery i want to make clear i am not going to shoot anybody possibly a very american analogy but another great soundbite the basic point is that the eu seeks political integration to move the entire nexus of decision making away from britain and we oppose that and the tories cannot be trusted to oppose it so is ukip s job to destroy the tories as former member robert kilroy silk once notoriously declared no the aim of ukip is to withdraw from the eu and if it has any relation to the tories it is to stiffen the tories spine on the issue by having a large enough ukip vote so that we move the tories in the direction they are refusing to move but it s not just to shift the tories i think ukip had a huge amount to do with tony blair s decision to hold a referendum on the european constitution and i think it had a huge amount to do with his refusal to go into the euro and while we are on the subject of mr kilroy silk mr morris despatches him with another of his neat soundbites robert kilroy silk is not a team player it is a good idea our party stands for some thing and not some one so what is the big plan for the general election how will he achieve the breakthrough look we are not going to be forming the next government he said neither does ukip have to fight every seat as with the 2004 us presidential election he says the outcome will be decided by a small number of swing seats just as he believes it will in britain so with limited resources the aim is to target those seats and end the day with a significant group in the commons he also believes it is possible the internet could have a big part in the poll the internet was a decisive factor in the 2004 presidential election through blogs individuals posting their views in online diaries people just did it anything can happen in the next general election there is an inherent instability at the moment labour and the tories have drawn the consensus so tightly and to the left there is room for another voice that might he suggests lead to a hung parliament with ukip and others holding the balance of power it is a huge task surely but there is undoubtedly a sense that the next general election may indeed produce some surprises even while most still believe it is labour s for the taking ukip s performance in last year s european elections was just such a shocker and showed that mr morris may have a point about the new consensus and after all he has a reputation to sustain
1,fresh hope after argentine crisis three years after argentina was hit by a deadly economic crisis there is fresh hope the country s economy is set to grow about 8 this year after seeing 9 growth last year a sharp turnaround from 2002 when output fell 11 the unemployment rate is improving too it is set to slip below 13 by the end of the year down from 20 in may 2002 true problems remain but the overall picture is one of vast improvement even the international monetary fund imf admits this the argentine authorities are proud should be proud of the strong performance of the economy thomas dawson an imf director said earlier this month argentina has made a remarkable recovery from a hideous and lengthy recession which in 2001 culminated in the government halting debt repayments to its private creditors the debt default sparked a deep and prolonged economic crisis which at least initially was made worse by the government s decisions pension payments were halted and bank accounts frozen as part of austerity measures introduced by the government to deal with the country s massive debts in response angry crowds of ordinary argentines took to the streets where dozens of lives were lost in clashes with the police two presidents and at least three finance minister resigned in less than a month argentina was on the brink of collapse the fix was found in the currency markets with the abandonment of the peso s decade long peg to the us dollar in february 2002 the subsequent devaluation saw thousands of people s life savings disappear scathes of companies went bust three years ago every sector of the economy was hit by the crisis said entrepreneur drayton valentine it really was dire but since then the general mood on the ground has improved dramatically in part because the devaluation helped attract fresh direct investment from abroad and stimulate business within brazil agriculture and tourism are helping said entrepreneur drayton valentine mr valentine who was born in the united states but grew up in argentina was fortunate at the time of the crisis his savings were held in dollar accounts abroad but now he is using his money to help with the start up a trading company he explained that initially his firm is going to export building materials to spain and united states then he would like to diversify to other areas depending on the market locally there is a sense of recovery many companies are exporting now he said noting that a lot of firms which were closed during the crisis are re opening but not all that shines is gold argentina is still burdened by its failure to pay private creditors at the end of 2001 president nestor kirchner s administration is still trying to hammer out an agreement with the creditors but with the debts nominal value standing at around 100bn it is not proving easy debt defaults make further lending agreements both difficult and expensive to negotiate argentina s current offer implies that the creditors would get just 25 cents for each dollar they are owed according to the creditors understandably they want more and until they do both they and others are loath to continue lending for president kirchner this proves a hopeless challenge real losses have been suffered and somebody has to pay observed jack boorman adviser to imf s managing director rodrigo rato everyone needs to keep in mind the enormous cost on the part of both creditors and the argentine society and people that will have been endured by the time a settlement is reached he said the cost is enormous and continues to be paid and will not be reversed by any restructuring with the international negotiations being troubled it is of little help to president kirchner that the domestic situation remains strained as well this is partly because there are still bank account holders who are waiting to recover some of their deposits the situation is bad for those who had previously chosen to save in argentina said carlos baez silva president of aara an association that represents bank account and bond holders few people have recovered more than about half their savings mr baez silva estimated pointing out that many of the savers who have lost out are pensioners or others who once trusted the government people who set aside money for the future in the belief that their investment would be safe a lot of them invested in good faith he said the argentine state responded by taking most of their investments the affair has made mr baez silva disillusioned with the country s legal system on occasion the supreme court has ruled against the interests of the people he represents he says insisting that the system cannot be trusted people have to deposit their money in the banks not necessarily because they trust them but because crime is so high that people cannot have their money in their homes beneath their mattresses mr valentine who was born in the united states but grew up in argentina agreed if i have to save pesos the local currency there is not much problem but i will think twice before i deposit dollars in a bank
4,labour s election love in peace and love have been in short supply in the labour party in recent days if press reports are to be believed alan milburn and gordon brown have been at each other s throats over the contents of labour s next election manifesto but the pair were all smiles on tuesday morning as they joined john prescott to unveil labour s latest poster campaign the event at old billingsgate fish market on the banks of the thames was a carefully choreographed show of unity and the surest sign yet that we are heading for a general election in the next few months it was also one of the most bizarre photo opportunities of recent years the first inkling something slightly odd was afoot was when in place of the soft rock music normally chosen for such occasions labour s speakers crackled to life with the sound of booker t and the mgs then a vw camper van trundled into view decked out in that most mind bending of psychedelic messages lowest mortgage rate for 40 years as the side door slid open it looked for one glorious moment as if the cabinet had decided to bury their differences and go on the road together scooby doo style but sadly it wasn t the cabinet who had raided the dressing up box just six rather ill at ease looking labour students two were dressed as regency dandies to unveil a poster trumpeting the longest period of economic growth for 200 years another pair of students were in a beatle wig and sgt pepper jacket to highlight the lowest interest rates since the 1960s the remaining two were dressed in a vague approximation of disco chic to demonstrate the lowest unemployment since the seventies the politicians led out by john prescott were soberly suited as always the event may have been designed to highlight labour s economic success under mr brown but there was little doubt who was in charge the chancellor walked side by side with mr milburn pointedly exchanging chit chat as they approached the microphone but it was mr milburn who took centre stage speaking of the positive campaign the party hoped to stage in the coming weeks and months the mobile poster vans would let people know britain is working again mr brown repeated the familiar mantras displayed on the posters and spoke of labour s shared purpose and united dedication it was left to mr prescott to pay glowing tribute to the chancellor s record and in a final flourish to produce his famous pledge card from 1997 claiming labour has met all of its promises the event was carefully stage managed to underline cabinet unity and more specifically to demonstrate the central role mr brown will play in the election campaign despite being sidelined as campaign chief in favour of mr milburn but keen students of body language will have had a field day there was much forced smiling for the cameras but only mr prescott who revels in such occasions seemed to be truly enjoying himself mr milburn made a point of turning to face the chancellor as he spoke nodding thoughtfully but it was the former health secretary s final gesture placing an arm on mr brown s back as they walked away from the microphones which was perhaps the most telling thanks for dropping by gordon he might have been saying

carefully to make sure all parts work together experienced and keen pc users building your own pc or upgrading the one you have is a great way to improve your understanding of how it all works it s cheap you can specify exactly what you want and you get the thrill of putting it together yourself and a bigger thrill if everything works as it should once it s built you won t be able to do much

2,wenger keeping faith with almunia arsene wenger has pledged to keep faith with stand in keeper manuel almunia for the crunch week which could define arsenal s season almunia will start tuesday s champions league group tie against rosenborg and is likely to face chelsea on sunday wenger said you don t think i would take out one goalkeeper for just one game do you i don t do that i have to give him a run for a few games it s just that i don t want to make this story bigger than it is wenger insists he has complete faith in the 27 year old spaniard who was signed last summer from celta vigo as back up to jens lehmann if you look at my career you will see that i have left many big players out for a long time i ve done it with dennis bergkamp kanu everybody it s because it s a goalkeeper that s all it s a usual situation for me you put your best team out no matter who it is for me it was not a big mistake at old trafford and i wasn t alarmed by what happened against birmingham either it s nothing against lehmann i think he s a great keeper as is almunia you can only play one of them these people are not robots they have good periods and less good periods just because lehmann doesn t play for two or three weeks or longer or shorter it doesn t mean i ve lost faith in him but former arsenal keeper david seaman believes lehmann has been harshly treated seaman told the daily mail jens is a fantastic keeper he deserves another chance he has made a few mistakes but on form he deserves to be the first team choice with arsenal hit by injuries and suspension inexperienced midfield pair of mathieu flamini and cesc fabregas will line up against rosenborg but wenger is confident they will prove more than capable it puts a lot of pressure on them but it s a good learning process said wenger i m not worried as they are both mentally strong and will put in the needed workrate the gunners go into the game boosted by the news that defender sol campbell is on the verge of signing a new deal with the club and the 30 year old whose current contract runs out in the summer has made it clear he is determined to achieve champions league success with arsenal campbell said it means a lot to me to go through it s everything we want to carry on in this competition that s where the best teams in europe are to be in there playing against these guys and trying to win the trophy is the first thing in my mind meanwhile thierry henry believes he will be blamed if arsenal fail to qualify for the next stage of the champions league henry will captain the side in place of the suspended patrick vieira as the gunners seek the required victory over rosenborg and the striker said if we don t win and we go out of the competition like it or not it s going to be my fault that s the way it is if the team don t win i know i will be criticised no matter how i play
0,gritty return for prince of persia still basking in the relatively recent glory of last year s sands of time the dashing prince of persia is back in warrior within and in a more bellicose mood than last time this sequel gives the franchise a grim gritty new look and ramps up the action and violence as before you control the super athletic prince from a third person perspective the time travelling plot hinges on the dahaka an all consuming monster pursuing our hero through the ages the only way to dispel it is to turn back the clock again and kill the sultry empress of time before she ever creates the sands of time that caused the great beast s creation studiously structured though this back story is everything boils down to old fashioned fantasy gameplay which proves on the whole as dependable as it needs to be ever since the series then groundbreaking beginnings on the commodore amiga prince of persia has always been about meticulously animated acrobatic moves that provide an energetic blend of leaping preposterously between pieces of scenery and lopping off enemies body parts those flashy moves are back in full evidence and tremendous fun to perform and perfect combining them at speed is the best fun although getting a handle of doing so takes practice and plenty of skill until you reach that point it is a haphazard business all too often you will perform a stunning triple somersault pirouette off a wall knock out three enemies in one glorious swoop before plummeting purposefully over a cliff to your doom that in turn can mean getting set back an annoyingly long distance for you can only save at the fountains dotted along the path the expected fiendish puzzles are all present and correct but combat is what is really been stepped up and there is more of it than before the game s developers have combined acrobatic flair with gruesome slaying techniques in some wonderfully imaginative ways slicing foes down the middle is one particularly entertaining method of seeing them off warrior within is a very slick package the game s intro movie is so phenomenally good that it actually does an ultimate disservice once the game itself commences it is on a par with the jaw dropping opening sequence of onimusha 3 earlier this year and when the game begins it is something of an anti climax that said the graphics are excellent and indeed among the most striking and satisfying elements of the game the music is probably the worst aspect a merit free heavy metal soundtrack that you will swiftly want to turn off there is something strangely unsatisfying about the game perhaps precisely because its graphics and mechanics are so good that the story and overall experience are not quite as engaging as they should be somehow it adds up to less than the sum of its parts and is more technically impressive than it is outright enjoyable but that is not to say warrior within is anything other than a superb adventure that most will thoroughly enjoy it just does not quite take the character to the new heights that might have been hoped for
2,paris promise raises welsh hopes has there been a better six nations match than saturday s epic in paris and can the welsh revival continue all the way to a first grand slam since 1978 those are the two questions occupying not just wales supporters but rugby fans as a whole after a scintillating display in paris welsh legend mervyn davies a member of two of three grand slam winning sides of the 1970s hailed it as one of the great performances of the past three decades martyn williams wales two try scorer on the day called it one of the most surreal games i have ever played in a crestfallen france coach bernard laporte simply observed there was a french half and there was a welsh half and what a half it was for the red dragonhood transforming a 15 6 half time deficit into an 18 15 lead within five mesmerising minutes of the second period but while that passage of play showed the swelling self belief of a side prepared to back its own spirit of adventure the final quarter told us a whole lot more about this welsh side that they recovered from a battering in the first half hour to first stem the tide before half time then reverse it on the resumption was remarkable enough but in resisting a seemingly unstoppable wave of french pressure in a nail biting final five minutes wales showed not only their physical attributes but their mental resolve in international rugby any of the top seven sides can beat each other on a given day but the great sides are those that win the close contests on a consistent basis england suffered some infamous six nations disappointments en route to world cup glory the pain of defeat forging bonds that ultimately led to victory when it really mattered wales have some way to go before they can be remotely considered in a similar light but the signs are that players previously on the receiving end are learning how to emerge on the right side of the scoreline ten of the 22 on duty on saturday were also involved when wales were trounced 33 5 in paris two years ago but since they threw off the shackles against new zealand in the 2003 world cup wales have rediscovered much of what made them a great rugby nation in the first place the confidence in the squad has been building and building since the world cup and we now have young players who are becoming world class noted coach mike ruddock the likes of michael owen gethin jenkins dwayne peel and gavin henson are certainly building strong cases for inclusion on this summer s lions tour to new zealand and players like stephen jones martyn williams shane williams and gareth thomas are proving it is not only the youngsters that are on an upward curve jones after his superb man of the match display observed that we are a very happy camp now ruddock and thomas can take much of the credit for that ensuring the tribal and regional divisions that have often scarred welsh rugby do not extend to the national squad the joie de vivre so evident in that magical second half spell in paris also stems from a style of play that first wooed supporters the world over in the 1970s if england had half the innate attacking exuberance wales have produced in this championship they would not be contemplating the debris of three consecutive defeats similarly wales have learnt that style alone does not win matches and that forward power mental toughness and good decision making under pressure are equally important so on to murrayfield where wales have not won on their last three visits while the hype in the principality will go into overdrive the players will set about the task of beating scotland only then with the visit of ireland to finish can they start thinking about emulating the hallowed players of the 1970s and writing their own names into welsh legend

0,blind student hears in colour a blind student has developed software that turns colours into musical notes so that he can read weather maps victor wong a graduate student from hong kong studying at cornell university in new york state had to read coloured maps of the upper atmosphere as part of his research to study space weather mr wong needed to explore minute fluctuations in order to create mathematical models a number of solutions were tried including having a colleague describe the maps and attempting to print them in braille mr wong eventually hit upon the idea of translating individual colours into music and enlisted the help of a computer graphics specialist and another student to do the programming work the images have three dimensions and i had to find a way of reading them myself mr wong told the bbc news website for the sake of my own study and for the sake of blind scientists generally i felt it would be good to develop software that could help us to read colour images he tried a prototype version of the software to explore a photograph of a parrot in order to have an exact reference to the screen a pen and tablet device is used the software then assigns one of 88 piano notes to individually coloured pixels ranging from blue at the lower end of this scale to red at the upper end mr wong says the application is still very much in its infancy and is only useful for reading images that have been created digitally if i took a random picture and scanned it and then used my software to recognise it it wouldn t work that well mr wong has been blind from the age of seven and he thinks that having a colour memory makes the software more useful than it would be to a scientist who had never had any vision as the notes increase in pitch i know the colour s getting redder and redder and in my mind s eye a patch of red appears the colour to music software has not yet been made available commercially and mr wong believes that several people would have to work together to make it viable but he hopes that one day it can be developed to give blind people access to photographs and other images

0,rings of steel combat net attacks gambling is hugely popular especially with tech savvy criminals many extortionists are targeting net based betting firms and threatening to cripple their websites with deluges of data unless a ransom is paid but now deep defences are being put in place by some of the uk s biggest net firms to stop these attacks increasing numbers of attacks and the huge amounts of data being used to try to bump a site off the web are prompting firms to adopt the measures net firms are realising that it s not just about anti virus and firewalls said paul king chief security architect at cisco there are more things that can be done in the network to protect data centres mr king said the only way to properly combat these so called distributed denial of service attacks was with intelligent net based systems many of the gambling sites suffering ddos attacks are in offshore data and hosting centres so any large scale data flood could knock out access to many more sites than just the one the criminals were targeting said mr king this overspill effect was only likely to grow as attacks grow in size and scale malcolm seagrave security expert at energis said the most common types of attacks hit sites with 10 megabytes of data over short periods of time bigger attacks sending down 200 megabytes of traffic or more were rarely seen he said it does feel like they are turning the dial because you see this traffic gradually growing he said so far there have been no attacks involving gigabytes of data said mr seagrave however he added that it was only a matter of time before such large attacks were mounted maria capella spokeswoman for net provider pipex said that when ddos attacks were at their height customers were getting hit every four to five days the defences being put in place constantly monitor the streams of data flowing across networks and pluck out the traffic destined for target sites it s about understanding what s genuine traffic and keeping attack traffic from going to the site she said we study the profile of their traffic and as soon as we see an anomaly in the profile that s when we start to get the backbone engineering boys to see if we are going to sustain an attack said ms capella this traffic can be hard to spot because ddos attacks typically use thousands of computers in many different countries each participating machine only sends a small part of the entire data flood typically these computers have been infected by a virus or worm which reports its success and the net address of compromised machines back to the malicious hacker or hi tech criminal that set off the virus hijacked computers are known as zombies or bots and collections of them are called bot nets many spammers rent out bot nets to help them anonymously send junk mail most of the zombies are based outside the country that hosts the target site so getting the attacking pcs shut off can be difficult often pipex and other net suppliers do get advance notice that an attack is about to happen the serious players tend to precede an attack with some kind of ransom e mail said ms capella we ask as part of the service we provide that customers notify us of anything they have in advance that would give us forewarning once an attack is spotted dedicated net hardware takes over to remove the attack traffic and ensure that sites stay up energis took a similar approach said mr seagrave we have technology out there that allows us to detect attacks in minutes rather than let network engineers spend hours pulling the information together said mr seagrave also net firms were starting to work more closely together on the problem of ddos attacks and pool information about where they are coming from information gathered on attacks and where they originated has led to some arrests he said energis also did its own intelligence work to get in insight into which sites criminal gangs plan to target we have people in places where they shouldn t be monitoring tech sites he said sometimes though he said spotting the next victim was easy you can see them going alphabetically through the list with the gambling sites trying one after another said mr seagrave

4,brown hits back in blair rift row gordon brown has criticised a union leader who said conflict between himself and tony blair was harming the workings of government jonathan baume of the top civil servants union spoke of competing agendas between mr brown and mr blair but the chancellor said mr baume was never at meetings between himself and the prime minister so could not judge he said the union leader was trying to block civil service reform which threatened his members jobs it suited the purpose of mr baume s union the first division association to suggest there were two agendas battling against each other because the union was trying to resist the planned reforms mr brown told bbc radio 4 s today programme under the plans unveiled in the gershon report some 84 000 civil servants jobs will be axed or changed and the savings ploughed back into frontline services mr brown said to be honest i don t think you can rely on his mr baume s judgement on this matter when it comes to the decisions that the government are making mr blair and i are making exactly the same decisions on civil service reforms we are determined to go on with the gershon reforms he also said that as mr baume was never present at meetings between himself and the prime minister he was not in a position to judge on wednesday ahead of the chancellor s pre budget report mr baume told bbc news there were sometimes conflicting and competing agendas for government between number 10 and the treasury what the chancellor wanted was not by any means what alan milburn and the prime minister want to see mr baume said government departments get their money from the treasury on the basis of public service agreements they sign up to but at the same time the prime minister also has an agenda and that s not necessarily the same as the treasury s and the prime minister is of course a very powerful figure in any government he also sends instructions and messages and directions to departments about how he would like each secretary of state and each department to implement a policy agenda the problem is that on many occasions these two don t add up and individual cabinet ministers as well as departments have to make sense of this battle number 10 said ministers were interested in governing and not a soap opera about mr blair and mr brown tory shadow chancellor oliver letwin said the battle royal that the top civil servants are now reporting on between the chancellor and tony blair is preventing them both from getting on with the business of getting taxpayers value for money

2,2004 an irish athletics year 2004 won t be remembered as one of irish athletics great years the year began with that optimism which invariably and unaccountably seems to herald an upcoming olympiad but come late august a few hot days in the magnificent stadium in athens told us of the true strength of irish athletics or to be more accurate the lack of it sonia o sullivan s olympic farewell apart there was little to stir the emotions of irish athletics watchers but after the disastrous build up to the games we shouldn t have been surprised at the start of the year an o sullivan had been earmarked as ireland s best medal prospect but as it turned out walker gillian never even made it to the start line because of injury less than a week before the olympics the sport was rocked by news that 10 000m hope cathal lombard had tested for the banned substance epo lombard s shattering of mark carroll s national 10 000m record in april had already set tongues wagging but even the most cynical of observers were surprised when he was rumbled after an irish sports council sting operation the corkman quickly held his hands up in admission and was promptly handed a two year ban from the sport back at pre olympic ranch in greece it must have seemed that things couldn t have got any worse but they very nearly did with walker jamie costin lucky to escape with his life after being involved in a car crash near athens once the track and field action began in athens a familiar pattern of underachievement emerged although alistair cragg s performance in being the only athlete from a european nation to qualify for the 5 000m final did offer hope for the future our beloved sonia scraped into the women s 5k final as a fastest loser and for a couple of days the country attempted to delude itself into believing that she might be in the medal shake up as it happened she went out the back door early in the final although there was nothing undignified about the way that she insisted on finishing the race over a minute behind winner meseret defar it later transpired that sonia had been suffering from a stomach bug in the 48 hours before the final although typically the cobhwoman played down the effects of the illness amazingly she was back in action a couple of weeks later when beating a world class field at the flora lite 5k road race in london and while her major championship days may be over it s unlikely that we have seen the last of her in competition at least sonia managed to make it to athens at the start of the year several northern ireland athletes had genuine hopes of qualifying for the games but come august an out of form and injured paul brizzel was the lone standard bearer for the province the ballymena man gave it a lash but his achilles problem and a bad lane draw meant a time of 21 00 and an early exit james mcilroy gareth turnbull zoe brown and paul mckee all had to be content with watching the athens action on their television screens 800m hope mcilroy never got near his best during the summer and a fourth place in the british trials effectively ended his hopes of making the plane the injury plagued turnbull gamely travelled round europe in search of the 1500m qualifying mark but 3 39 was the best he could achieve after missing several months training during the previous winter a lingering hamstring probem and a virus wrecked mckee s athens ambitions and both he and turnbull deserve a slice of better fortune in 2005 pole vaulter brown had hoped for a vote of confidence from the british selectors after she had achieved the athens b standard but the call never came as the summer ended stalwarts catherina mckiernan and dermot donnelly hung up their competitive spikes mckiernan had to candidly acknowledge that time had crept up on her after several injury ravaged years donnelly and his annadale striders team mates later suffered tragedy when their friend and clubman andy campbell was found dead at his home on 18 december a large turnout of athletics loving folk turned out in west belfast to offer their respects to the campbell family and andy s many friends as only death can it put the year s athletics happenings in a sharp perspective

1,could yukos be a blessing in disguise other things being equal the notion of entrepreneurs languishing in jail while their companies are sold off for a song ought to be bad for business but in the looking glass world of modern russia the opposite might just be true a new report has argued the study from the centre for economic policy research does not praise the rough handling of oil company yukos but it argues that more rigorous tax policing has benefited all russian firms even targets of the tax police an increase in tax enforcement can increase the amount of dividends and other income outside shareholders will receive even accounting for increased levels of taxation the authors say the paper s reasoning is complex and is based on a sophisticated model of the relationship between tax regimes and corporate governance in particular the propensity of management to steal from the company the calculations demonstrated what many russian analysts already knew that increasing the tax rate increases the amount that managers steal since undeclared income becomes relatively more valuable in the west meanwhile higher tax rates translate far more smoothly into higher government revenues on the other hand increasing the rigour with which taxes are collected encourages companies to become more transparent forcing them to be able to demonstrate their financial position far more accurately the net result the authors say is that the extra amount companies pay in tax is more than compensated for by greater efficiency and financial soundness after vladimir putin became president in 2000 he did not raise taxes but put a lot of effort too much critics argue into enforcement since then the russian stock market has more than trebled in value a rise the authors attribute at least in part to the newly tough approach the report highlights the case of sibneft a russian oil company that came close to merging with yukos last year after mr putin came to power the company s overall effective tax rate rose from 2 6 to 10 4 and sibneft was the target of a series of aggressive raids by fiscal police but shareholders benefited hugely sibneft started to pay dividends 53m in 2000 and almost 1bn in 2001 and closed down the network of opaque subsidiaries it had previously used for siphoning off unofficial funds according to the authors although a variety of changes were sweeping through russian industry at the time the increase in tax enforcement is the only likely explanation for the change of fortunes at sibneft and many of its peers does this analysis make sense in part certainly for all its faults corporate russia has become far more orderly and law abiding since 2000 companies have rushed to list their shares on international stock exchanges something unthinkable in the wilder days of the 1990s and most large firms now produce their accounts to international standards foreign direct investment long negligible is starting to flow in serious amounts 7bn in 2003 and stock market returns have been among the healthiest in europe but the authors model does not quite cover all the complexities for a start the model assumes that the various parties have clearly defined motivation companies want to maximise profit governments want to maximise tax revenue in fact the alarmingly close connections between big business and government in russia connections often greased by bribery blur the apparently antagonistic relationship companies can for example persuade officials to overlook non payment of taxes and the authors definition of tax enforcement seems unrealistically western genuine disinterested tax collection might well work wonders in russia the problem with recent examples has been the erratic and unpredictable way laws are enforced the case against yukos for example has moved in fits and starts with little clarity from the government about its intentions and little faith from investors that the letter of the law would be followed as far as most commentators are concerned the state is pursuing yukos out of a political vendetta rather than simply to enforce fiscal rectitude since yukos founder mikhail khodorkovsky was arrested a year ago the russian market has dropped by 10 an indication that few investors feel optimistic about the salutary effect on corporate performance

3,german music in a zombie state the german music business the third largest in the world is in the state of a zombie because it has failed to respond to the challenge posed by downloading and piracy a leading industry figure has said tim renner the head of universal music germany until last year told bbc world service s the music biz programme that the country s music industry was now struggling to survive renner warned that unless the industry accepted new realties such as downloading its decline could become irreversible the problem the music industry has got is that they aren t willing to accept that the classic way of doing business is over and out he stated so the music industry in its current form over here is pretty much in the state of a zombie the music market in germany peaked in 1997 with sales of 2 6bn euros 1 8bn since 2000 sales have plummeted to just 1 6bn euros 1 1bn in 2003 in the space of one year between 2002 and 2003 cd album sales fell by 13 8 but a study by the society for consumer research found that at the same time more than twice as many recordable cds had music recorded on them than cd albums were sold mr renner pointed out that because profit comes mainly from the longevity of a good selling record this was particularly damaging you need time he added however peter zombic the managing director of the international federation of phonographic industry in germany said he did not feel the situation was as dramatic as mr renner believed it s quite true that we have severe problems in germany but that s true in other parts of the world and in most developed markets too he argued we have a severe problem with piracy especially internet piracy and we also have a severe problem of private copying i don t agree that the music industry lost control over the music market in fact especially in regard to germany talent the market is quite successful he did however admit that copyright owners have partly lost control of their copyright due to piracy and copying but he refuted suggestions that the industry had been too slow to respond to digital downloading we were the first to implement a download service back in 1997 he argued at that time it was not successful because of the advent of piracy it was the napster time when p2p services became popular it still is quite difficult for the music industry to compete with a price that is zero as far as the illegal product is concerned mr zombic also called for a change to the perception in germany that private copying of music is not a problem german law does allow people to make copies of cds for their family and close friends without fear of breaking copyright mr zombic said that this legal framework was a huge problem there is a widespread attitude that private copying is a hobby it s nice it s fun he added we try to make clear it s not nice and it s not fun it s endangering the creativity in our country

2,parry puts gerrard above money listen to the full interview on sport on five and the bbc sport website from 1900 gmt but parry speaking exclusively to bbc sport also admits gerrard who has been constantly linked with chelsea will have the final say on his future he told bbc five live steven is above money he is the future of liverpool it doesn t matter if it s 30m 40m or 50m we will not accept offers but we are also realistic enough to know we can t keep steven against his will on the subject of liverpool s finances parry also revealed the club is ready to explore the possibility of a sponsorship deal for its proposed new stadium and responding to criticism from bbc sport pundit and former liverpool stalwart alan hansen he insisted talks on new investment are ongoing but added the door has not closed on shareholder and lifelong fan steve morgan parry joined liverpool as chief executive in july 1998 from a similar role at the premier league there have been several highs and lows during his time in charge at anfield and he had a busy summer overseeing the arrival of new manager rafael benitez and managing to hold on to steven gerrard on the subject of liverpool s captain and prize asset parry revealed real madrid did ask for an option on the england midfield man during negotiations for striker fernando morientes he said they were looking for ways of saying they got more out of the deal for fernando morientes but the response to real madrid was the same steven is not for sale but when asked if gerrard would be a liverpool player on the first day of next season parry said i sincerely hope he will be steven knows my views he knows rafa s views we have re affirmed recently to steven that we are trying to build a team around him we crave success as much as he does we know he s ambitious and nobody can argue with that i think steven would dearly love to win things with liverpool more than he d like to do anything else we all want to see progress by next season he s not alone in that there are a lot of other players who feel the same so we all have a common aim it is expected chelsea will test liverpool with a 30m plus bid in the summer but parry claims he will be in no mood to listen there have been a lot of open secrets about steven most of which have been complete myths it is suggested we had a deal tied up last summer we didn t had an offer last summer parry explained we had told chelsea that as far as we were concerned he was not for sale and we didn t want to sell him in reality it didn t go beyond that maybe there will be an offer in the summer maybe there won t our position is we want steven to stay but we are also realistic enough and have enough respect for steven and he has enough respect for us to know that it is his decision that will be crucial you are not going to keep a player like steven against his will that just doesn t work but any idea we are going to accept offers for steven and then tell him by the way we ve decided to sell you is not on the agenda you can forget that parry is currently in the process of finalising funding for liverpool s new stadium in stanley park which is set to open in 2007 and he confessed arsenal s 100m deal with emirates to sponsor their new ground complete with naming rights has given the anfield club serious food for thought he said i have to say historically it is something i have been against and i have been on record as saying that but i think the size of the arsenal deal is a real eye opener i would say in the past deals have been done frankly far too cheaply and it just hasn t even been worth contemplating but the arsenal deal is the sort of deal that causes you to draw breath and say wow that s interesting my personal point of view is that i would find it a hell of a lot more palatable than a shared stadium some liverpool fans would find such a move highly controversial but parry countered i recognise it would be an emotive issue for many supporters but you look at the amount of money available and it could go into the team if it was the right partner how strong an issue is it time will tell i think the stadium will always be anfield not least because of where it is but do we need to investigate the possibilities of sponsorship i think it would be remiss not to that s not to say we have made a decision that we will go down that road but i think it is clearly something we have to explore on the subject of possible new investment parry revealed liverpool are still in negotiations with a mystery investor with rumours of interest from the middle east that prompted the withdrawal of tycoon steve morgan who got frustrated by failed bids and what he claimed was indecision by the board he also accused liverpool of using him as a stalking horse to attract other bids but parry explained steve has never been used as a stalking horse there s no need and that is not the way we do business we had discussions with steve over the course of 2004 i think we came close to concluding a deal in the summer but it didn t happen quite genuinely the new interest did appear relatively late in the day just prior to the agm in december and as i have said it was of such potential magnitude and that potential is so exciting we felt we had to evaluate it we are still evaluating it steve s interest was taken very much on its own merits his enthusiasm for the club is there for all to see and who knows what the next few months will hold the door isn t closed on anything we had a perfectly sensible dialogue with steve last year we have a common interest in making liverpool successful that s a dream we all share so as far as i m concerned the door is not closed i would take 50m if we had no investment but if we did keep him as for the stadium if it gets us cash what difference does it make really 50m for gerrard i don t care who you are the directors would take the money and it is the way it should be we cannot let that sum of money go despite gerrard s quality through a cleverly worded statement the club has effectively forced gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself which i think is the right thing to do critical time for liverpool with regards to gerrard ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term i am hoping he doesn t walk out of the club like michael owen did for very little cash 50m realistically would allow rafa to completely rebuild the squad however if we can afford to do this and keep gerrard we will be better for it i would however be happy with gerrard s transfer for any fee over 35m parry s statements are clever in that any future gerrard transfer cannot be construed as a lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players upping the ante is another smart move by parry i would keep gerrard no amount of money could replace his obvious love of the club and determination to succeed the key is if gerrard comes out and says that he is happy clearly if he isn t then we would be foolish not to sell the worrying thing is who would you buy or who would come pending possible non champions league football
2,hansen delays return until 2006 british triple jumper ashia hansen has ruled out a comeback this year after a setback in her recovery from a bad knee injury according to reports hansen the commonwealth and european champion has been sidelined since the european cup in poland in june 2004 it was hoped she would be able to return this summer but the wound from the injury has been very slow to heal her coach aston moore told the times we re not looking at any sooner than 2006 not as a triple jumper moore said hansen may be able to return to sprinting and long jumping sooner but there is no short term prospect of her being involved again in her specialist event there was a problem with the wound healing and it set back her rehabilitation by about two months but that has been solved and we can push ahead now he said the aim is for her to get fit as an athlete then we will start looking at sprinting and the long jump as an introduction back to the competitive arena moore said he is confident hansen can make it back to top level competition though it is unclear if that will be in time for the commonwealth games in melbourne next march when she will be 34 it s been a frustrating time for her but it has not fazed her determination he added

0,apple laptop is greatest gadget the apple powerbook 100 has been chosen as the greatest gadget of all time by us magazine mobile pc the 1991 laptop was chosen because it was one of the first lightweight portable computers and helped define the layout of all future notebook pcs the magazine has compiled an all time top 100 list of gadgets which includes the sony walkman at number three and the 1956 zenith remote control at two gadgets needed moving parts and or electronics to warrant inclusion the magazine staff compiled the list and specified that gadgets also needed to be a self contained apparatus that can be used on its own not a subset of another device in general we included only items that were potentially mobile said the magazine in the end we tried to get to the heart of what really makes a gadget a gadget it concluded the oldest gadget in the top 100 is the abacus which the magazine dates at 190 a d and put in 60th place other pre electronic gadgets in the top 100 include the sextant from 1731 59th position the marine chronometer from 1761 42nd position and the kodak brownie camera from 1900 28th position the tivo personal video recorder is the newest device to make the top 10 which also includes the first flash mp3 player diamond multimedia as well as the first successful digital camera casio qv 10 and mobile phone motorola startac the most popular gadget of the moment the apple ipod is at number 12 in the list while the first sony transistor radio is at number 13 sony s third entry in the top 20 is the cdp 101 cd player from 1983 who can forget the crystalline hiss free blast of madonna s like a virgin emanating from their first cd player asked the magazine karl elsener s knife the swiss army knife from 1891 is at number 20 in the list gadgets which could be said to feature surprisingly low down in the list include the original telephone 23rd the nintendo gameboy 25th and the pulsar quartz digital watch 36th the list also contains plenty of oddities the pez sweet dispenser 98th 1990s toy tamagotchi 86th and the bizarre ronco inside the shell egg scrambler 84th almost everyone has a mobile phone how many people own a powerbook or an ipod the findings of this magazine are not very convincing what about the magnetic compass we still use it 1 000 years after it was invented i am amazed by the obsession with individual gadgets rather than genre for example the sony walkman was the first truly portable way of listening to your own music on the move whereas minidisc flash mp3 portable cd players etc are really just improvements in technology my favourite true gadgets are probably my portable minidisc player and the little battery powered whizzy thing i use to froth up my coffee calm down it s only in their opinion and any list that includes the taser in the top 100 gadgets has to be suspect swiss army knife and no question about it how many of the other items are still relatively unchanged from the original idea and still as useful popular you don t need a laptop or even a pocket calculator to work that one out this list merely illustrates interesting cultural divides between the american authors and the overwhelmingly british responses brits see no further than mobile phones and the over thirties sinclair whilst the americans focus on apple tv remotes and tivo which probably is rather obscure in europe what about the soda stream this gadget changed my pre teen life lap tops may enable you to think different but you cant use them to get busy with the fizzy how about astro wars one of the pioneers for computer games i remember spending many an hour playing this and it still works today however tried it the other day and it was rubbish still a great gadget of its time why worry about mobile phones soon they will be subsumed into the pda s laptops etc what about the marine chronometer completely revolutionised navigation for boats and was in use for centuries for it s time a technological marvel sony net minidisc it paved the way for more mp3 player to explode onto the market i always used my netmd and could not go anywhere without it a laptop computer is not a gadget it s a working tool the sinclair executive was the world s first pocket calculator i think this should be there as well how about the clockwork radio or gps or a pocket calculator all these things are useful to real people not just pc magazine editors are the people who created this list insane surely the most important gadget of the modern age is the mobile phone it has revolutionised communication which is more than can be said for a niche market laptop from outside the modern age the marine chronometer is the single most important gadget without which modern transportation systems would not have evolved so quickly has everyone forgot about the breville pie maker an interesting list of the electronic gadgets thousands of journalists in the early 1980s blessed the original noteboook pc the tandy 100 the size of a4 paper and light three weeks on a set of batteries an excellent keyboard a modem a pity tandy did not make it dos compatible what s an apple powerbook 100 it s out of date not much of a gadget surely it has to be something simple timeless the tin opener swiss army knife safety razor blade wristwatch or the thing for taking stones out of horses hooves it has to be the mobile phone no other single device has had such an effect on our way of living in such a short space of time the ball point pen has got to be one of the most used and common gadgets ever also many might be grateful for the pocket calculator which was a great improvement over the slide rule the casio pocket calculator that played a simple game and made tinny noises was also a hot gadget in 1980 a true gadget it could be carried around and shown off all top 10 are electronic toys so the list is probably a better reflection of the current high tech obsession than anything else i say this as the swiss army knife only made no 20 sinclair ql a machine far ahead of its time the first home machine with a true multi takings os shame the marketing was so bad apple a triumph of fashion over well everything else utter rubbish yes the apple laptop and sony walkman are classic gadgets but to call the sextant and the marine chronometer gadgets and rank them as less important than a tv remote control reveals a quite shocking lack of historical perspective the former literally helped change the world by vastly improving navigation at see the latter is the seed around which the couch potato culture has developed no competition i d also put apple s newton and the first palm pilot there as the front runners for portable computing and possibly the toshiba libretto for the same reason i only wish that vulcan inc s flipstart wasn t just vapourware otherwise it would be at the top how did a laptop ever manage to beat off the challenge of the wristwatch or the telephone mobile or otherwise what about radios and tvs the swiss army knife by far the most useful gadget i got mine 12 years ago still wearing and using it a lot it stood the test of time psion organiser series 3 should be up there had a usable qwerty keyboard removable storage good set of apps and programmable case design was good batteries in the hinge a first i think great product innovation the first mobile pc was voted best gadget by readers of err mobile pc why do you keep putting these obviously biased lists on your site it s obviously the mobile phone or remote control and readers of a less partisan publication would tell you that the motorola startac should be number one why there will be mobile phones long after notebook computers and other gadgets are either gone or integrated in communications devices the psion series 3c the first most practical way to carry all your info around i too would back the sinclair spectrum without this little beauty i would never have moved into the world of it and earn the living that i do now i d have put the mobile phone high up the list probably a nokia model sinclair spectrum 16k it plugged into the tv games were rubbish but it gave me a taste for programming and that s what i do for a living now i wish more modern notebooks even apple s newest offerings were more like the pb100 particularly disheartening is the demise of the trackball which has given way to the largely useless trackpad which every notebook on the market today uses they re invariably inaccurate uncomfortable and cumbersome to use congratulations to apple a deserved win
1,golden economic period to end ten years of golden economic performance may come to an end in 2005 with growth slowing markedly city consultancy deloitte has warned the uk economy could suffer a backlash from the slowdown in the housing market triggering a fall in consumer spending and a rise in unemployment deloitte is forecasting economic growth of 2 this year below chancellor gordon brown s forecast of 3 to 3 5 it also believes that interest rates will fall to 4 by the end of the year in its quarterly economic review deloitte said the uk economy had enjoyed a golden period during the past decade with unemployment falling to a near 30 year low and inflation at its lowest since the 1960s but it warned that this growth had been achieved at the expense of creating major imbalances in the economy deloitte s chief economic advisor roger bootle said the biggest hit of all is set to come from the housing market which has already embarked on a major slowdown whereas the main driver of the economy in recent years has been robust household spending growth this is likely to suffer as the housing market slowdown gathers pace economic growth is likely to be constrained during the next few years by increased pressure on household budgets and rising taxes deloitte believes gordon brown will need to raise about 10bn a year in order to sustain the public finances in the short term the firm claims this will result in a marked slowdown in growth in 2005 and 2006 compared to last year when the economy expanded by 3 25 however deloitte stressed that the slowdown was unlikely to have any major impact on retail prices while it expected the bank of england to respond quickly to signs of the economy faltering it expects a series of aggressive interest rate cuts over the next two years with the cost of borrowing falling from its current 4 75 mark to 3 5 by the end of 2006 although 2005 may not be the year when things go completely wrong it will probably mark the start of a more difficult period for the uk economy mr bootle

2,athens memories soar above lows well it s goodbye to another olympic year and as usual there were plenty of highs and lows in athens obviously there s no getting away from the differing fortunes of kelly holmes and paula radcliffe but i want to remind you of a few more events that made 2004 another year to remember or forget for athletics one of my favourite olympic moments was kelly s success in the 800m winning that race was the key to her success because if she won that then the 1500m would be a bit of a formality kelly had been full of should i shouldn t i thoughts about going for the double in athens i thought why wouldn t you do the 800m it s your best event it was such good fun to commentate on her 1500m and it was nice to be able to be part of her athens story the victory for the british men s 4x100m relay team was a bit of a surprise but a great climax to the games i think the four of them jason gardener darren campbell marlon devonish and mark lewis francis knew deep down that it was their best chance of a medal the lads had run poorly in the individual sprints so maybe they did lift their game when they knew something was really at stake hicham el guerrouj s olympic double is a much bigger achievement than kelly s on a global scale he was the first man since for 80 years to win both the 1500m and 5 000m titles as soon as he had added the 5 000m crown and i had finished commentating i jumped up ran down the stairs pushed everyone out the way and just gave him a big hug he is one of the few african runners who has embraced the tradition of the mile and he loves to hear all the roger bannister stories hicham is someone i enjoy having a bit of time with even though my french and his english are not very good what happened to paula in athens this year is the obvious low on a personal level and for the expectations of the nation as well there were a set of circumstances around athens that conspired to produce a very dramatic ending which i think has been greatly misunderstood dropping out of the marathon was the right thing to do but starting in the 10 000m five days later was not wise that was her heart and not her head reacting paula had a lot of little things going wrong in her preparation and on the day things like niggling injuries not being able to do all her running sessions and feeling the pressure of the race looming ahead of her i think she came to the start line in athens physically and emotionally drained and if even the smallest thing doesn t feel right when you are preparing to race a marathon 10 miles down the road it will hit you like a brick wall the positive thing to take from paula s olympics it that she will have learned a lot from it and so will a lot of people including me purely as a race paula s victory in the new york marathon has to go down as one of the most thrilling it was so nip and tuck between her and kenya s susan chepkemei and you don t usually get that kind of excitement in marathons it was also a real delight for all athletics fans because to use one of my favourite words paula showed real bouncebackability and it was a bit of a rarity for me too because i genuinely did not have an inkling how the race was going to pan out kelly and the 4x100m boys victories papered over the cracks in the general performance of the british team we should be concerned that we re not producing enough people who are capable of reaching finals at senior level the only individual men s finalist on the track was michael east in the 1500m i am beginning to look down and wonder where are the new breed and that s where things begin to look even gloomier for british athletics as we did not win any medals at the world junior championships in italy dani barnes came fourth in the 1500m and she was the highest finisher for team gb the thing is if we don t have athletes getting into the finals at junior level then it really doesn t look good for the beijing olympics and beyond i tell you what i really enjoyed this year benita johnson winning the world cross country championships back in march in the absence of paula we tend to think of the event as something of an african preserve so to have an australian come up and deliver such a surprise was something special to be honest i m getting bored with all the drug scandals especially balco i just wish the whole thing would come to a head so we can move on having said that i m always pleased when drugs cheats are caught because it shows the sport is standing up to it and not turning a blind eye anymore and one of the positive things to come out of balco is people are starting to blow the whistle we need more people to come forward and help the authorities kick out the cheats as regards the case against greek sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou well suspicions have been hanging over kenteris for a while the bottom line is we cannot keep letting drugs damage the sport because if we do then it stops everyone enjoying it
4,labour faces cold calls inquiry labour is to be investigated by a watchdog over claims its election campaign has broken the rules on cold calling householders the information commissioner is to look into a complaint from the lib dems about how labour uses its call centres the lib dems say labour is telephoning people who have signed up to make sure they do not get marketing calls labour denies breaking rules it says calls are not marketing if they just ask about people s voting intentions the party says it would expect the watchdog to take complaints seriously but it has clear legal advice on the issue telephone call centres are expected to be used as never before by all the three major parties in the run up to the general election but seven million telephone numbers are on the telephone preference service tps lists which ban unsolicited sales and marketing calls lib dem chairman matthew taylor has written to the watchdog accusing labour of a flagrant and systematic breach of the laws governing the tps he says the initial call may not be marketing but it identifies voters to whom the party can send promotional material in the future his letter to the commissioner quotes from a labour party handbook about identifying target voters and it quotes a stevenage labour party members newsletter explaining how voters will be telephoned about their voting intentions the voters are put in 24 categories according to their last known voting intention ranging from labour firm to target conservative those who supported the party in the past but this time will be voting tory the newsletter says using the information we know about people we can send them direct mailings for example we could send the target conservative people a letter from someone who had defected from the tories to labour explaining the reasons why voting tory is a bad idea or we could send labour weak people a letter encouraging them to sign up for a postal vote mr taylor tells the commissioner it is clear beyond peradventure from the above that the labour party is engaging in a large scale voter id project for subsequent promotional purposes through targeted and segmented mailings insofar as this project is directed at tps subscribers it is equally clear that it is unlawful the lib dems raised worries about labour and conservative calls in february and 680 people have signed up to the website they set up to help people to complain a party official said there was only scattered evidence of the tories breaking the rules but people had complained every day about labour a spokeswoman for the information commissioner s office said it was examining one complaint about political calls understood to be mr taylor s we are investigating one of the complaints where some evidence has been given to us she said obviously evidence is needed for us to start investigations the commissioner s office will now examine the lib dem evidence the guidance is that cold calling can be made as long as no marketing is going on said the spokeswoman if labour is judged to have broken the rules it will be asked stop immediately if it fails to do so after two or three warning letters the commissioner can issue an enforcement notice spelling out what the party needs to do or stop doing the party could appeal against the decision to an information tribunal if the appeal fails and it continues breaking the rules it could be fined up to 5 000 labour says it avoids those on tps lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising but not when making voter identification calls asked about the commissioner s inquiry a labour spokesman told bbc news we expect the information commissioner to take any complaint seriously however we are absolutely clear that we haven t broken any rules as the information commissioner himself has said if people are not marketing something if they are asking them which way they are going to vote they are not in breach of the law we always ask everyone we phone up whether they would be happy to be contacted by the labour party again

4,terror powers expose tyranny the lord chancellor has defended government plans to introduce control orders to keep foreign and british terrorist suspects under house arrest where there isn t enough evidence to put them on trial lord falconer insists that the proposals do not equate to a police state and strike a balance between protecting the public against the threat of terrorism and upholding civil liberties but thriller writer frederick forsyth tells bbc news of his personal response to the move there is a mortal danger aimed at the heart of britain or so says home secretary charles clarke my reaction so what it is not that i am cynical or just do not care i care about this country very much but in the 66 years that i have been alive there has not been one hour of one day of one month of one year when there has not been a threat aimed at us my point is the british have always coped without becoming a dictatorship we have coped with fear without becoming a state based on fear we have coped with threat without turning our country into a land of state threat but that is what the blair government now seeks to do create a tyranny to defend us from the al qaeda tyranny i was born on 25 august 1938 the mortal threat back then was a scruffy little austrian called adolf hitler a week after my first birthday the threat had become reality we were at war my father wore a uniform for five years after 1945 we yearned for peace at last but in 1946 winston churchill told us from the baltic to the adriatic an iron curtain has descended across europe behind the iron curtain another genocidal psychopath another threat josef stalin triggered the cold war with the berlin blockade in 1948 my whole generation was blighted by it we were threatened by the nuclear holocaust the nuclear wind the nuclear winter we built shelters that would have sheltered nothing we spent our treasure on weapons instead of hospitals we took silly precautions some fought it some marched futilely against it some pretended it was not there the cold war lasted 43 years but we remained a parliamentary democracy by the early seventies it was terrorism as well al fatah black september red brigades but most of all for us the ira and the inla thirty more years 300 policemen and women over 600 soldiers more than 3 000 civilians dead but we won because even ira bombs could not force us to become a tyranny that was why the tyrants lost civil rights were infringed as little as humanly possible evidence had to be taken in secret to protect covert sources yes and one judge no jury courts had to be instituted when juries were terrorised informants had to be given immunity from their own crimes to win the bigger battle but habeas corpus did not die right of appeal was not abolished now the threat is islamic fundamentalism its leaders want to destroy our society so did the ira it is based and funded abroad so was the ira it has sleeper fanatics inside our society so did the ira it is extremely hard to penetrate with our agents so was the ira the prime movers are not easy to bring to trial neither were the ira but we did and without becoming a tyranny now the blair government proposes the law system of fascism and communism the citizen can be arrested and held without charge or trial not even on the careful consideration of an experienced judge but the whim of a political activist called a government minister to be protected from terror the government says we must become a tyranny but a tyranny is based on the citizen s terror this is not victory this is defeat before a shot is fired an interesting article its good to see widening participation in the debate but i suggest we move one step further our own bombs and bullets will can only shatter peace because invading foreign nations imprisoning the innocent and hunting in the shadows cannot destroy an evil of the mind and hatred within the heart rather than focusing upon effect we should consider the cause because terrorism does not begin with bombs why not try a foreign policy of compassion it can only enhance our democracy and share our freedom i agree with frederick forsyth we really can t deal with terrorism by turning britain into a fascist state what we really need is more honesty from our security services and our politicians if they do not have evidence to bring these people to trial there probably isn t any our security services behave like the detective who having decided that a certain person is guilty rakes over all kinds of obscure and flimsy evidence to try and prove it while the real villain gets away remember there were no wmd in iraq just because a person may have made some stupid and naive decisions in life does not make them a terrorist in this overly politically correct society it is good to see someone like mr forsyth speak out yes there has been oppression by the british government in the past and overstepping the mark in places like ireland but yes we are still a democracy where it is rare to be arrested without charge trial etc apart from a number of prisoners in belmarsh goal for example this country signs up to human rights and then pretends that they only apply to the people with nothing to fear the innocent people defined by whom when id cards become mandatory the data collected will not be protected by the data protection act and will be readily available to people like gchq with no control by the person whose id is being checked the threat now is new you cannot compare the threats of past years with now forsyth says 3000 died over 30 years or terrorism 3000 people died in one morning in ny on september 11th 2001 the threat today is that terrorists will acquire nuclear or biological technology a kilo of semtex will flatten a building a kilo of plutonium will flatten a city you now have a combination of people who will perform terrorist acts with technology that is rapidly becoming accessible i agree the government is probably encouraging a degree of mass hysteria and talking up the threat but talking down the threat and doing nothing is unacceptable too the problem with this issue is not that it isn t important but the fact that in general we brits can be so politically apathetic some times that we will just let this go without telling the government no however as the nation that gave the world the common law and a true sense of the rights of individual liberty i hope this will prove to be one step too far as somebody of chinese origin i can say that this country used to be a good place to migrate and start a new life whilst life wasn t perfect we could make better for ourselves now we are riddled with red tape and be told what we can or cannot do we have to be politically correct and we are not allowed to have beliefs or opinions we have a prime minister who spends too much time meddling in us politics and affairs which have little to do with the lives of british citizens at home or abroad mr forsyth has done a good job in voicing his opinions let s hope the bbc doesn t get gagged for letting people express their views the people have the right to know and the bbc s role is to inform educate and entertain i agree terrorists intend to spread fear but in reality it is the government which has spread the fear by its constant publicising of the this invisible enemy so dangerous that we must allow them to ride roughshod over our rights and liberties in the end the very thing we seek to protect is what we are giving up in the name of safety from this invisible enemy the terrorists have already won i absolutely agree with frederick forsyth yes we have to defend ourselves against terrorism but existing laws seem to be more than adequate the idea that the new terrorism demands new powers is erroneous the evidence of any real terrorist capability in the uk is scant ricin for example is a dangerous poison but it is not a weapon of mass destruction what is really worrying is the enthusiasm of mr blair and his government for authoritarian reactions and attempts to manipulate the electorate through fear if the government has its way with id cards tracking and so on then totalitarianism has won and as such it then matters little whether we give in to the terrorists demands or not we will have lost the precious freedom which bush and blair constantly tells us we have and that they seek to bring to others i agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth i am shocked at the ease with which this government is prepared to wipe out a major portion of the liberties that british people have enjoyed for centuries the right not to be deprived of our liberty without a trial in open court that goes right back to magna carta and ordinary people have spilled their blood to enforce that right against governments who thought they knew best when you look at today s britain you realise george orwell was only wrong about one thing the date frederick forsyth puts it beautifully the government is seeking to introduce a police state the new powers of home internment without trial follow a pattern which includes the introduction of surveillance via compulsory id cards and the linking of data bases together with the un british idea that we will have to swear allegiance to the state at the age of 18 years we are sleep walking into this wake up an interesting view but missing two crucial facts of this new threat 1 if these terrorists acquire weapons of mass destruction they will use them without fear of mutually assured destruction that kept the cold war in a state of tense balance these people will use devastating force against us without fear of any consequence 2 the terrorists are prepared to use suicide bombers which means they could kill innocent people on the london underground and we could do very little to stop it because these terrorists are potentially so deadly we have to come up with new tougher responses it will be a little late in the day when people outside london wake up one morning to find out that london has been nuked we won t have much of a society left to debate he s correct in most of what he says mind you he does seem to have forgotten that disgraceful internment policy in northern ireland which probably caused many idealistic if misguided young catholics to join the ira administrative detention of muslims could have a similar effect now surely we the public would be better protected if the security services rather than alerting a suspect terrorist by placing them under house arrest and for how long they were to place suspect terrorist under surveillance and maybe acquire sufficient evidence to prosecute or even better prevent a terrorist attack i don t usually have much time for mr forsyth s largely right wing views but this time he has got it spot on there is no doubt that there are terrorist organisations who would like to do harm to the u k but it is very doubtful whether al qaeda is a global organisation co ordinating this the rise of surveillance cameras id cards the plan to charge for road use by tracking every vehicle at all times this is the stuff of nightmares add to this this new legislation which effectively means that the protection of the law will be removed from anyone at the whim of the home secretary and i genuinely wonder what sort of world my two children will inherit where will this end as it stands terrorists do not need to attack the u k it s government will soon have it s people terrorised more that they could very achieve with a few bombs mr forsyth has expressed exactly what my gut fears and reservations were about this proposed legislation but could not verbalise thank you mr forsyth seems to forget that killings in the troubles occurred on both sides of the religious divide and was carried out by killers from both sides he also forgets basic human rights were suspended then as now experienced judges sat over some of the greatest miscarriages of justice during those times for very little return and maximum alienation these laws and the emphasis on the islamic threat will just do the same forsyth is wrong the nature of the current threat is new it is no longer to our armed forces as the soviet threat in the eastern bloc was it is to you and i the terrorist aim to kill indiscriminately the best comparison is therefore the blitz 1941 at this time let us not forget suspects foreign and british were routinely rounded up and interned for the duration of the war without any complaints from the public we must not forget we are at war i d say that that the likelihood of an attack by a sleeper cell of fundamentalist lunatics against a major uk target is a when not an if probability i ll bet any money you like that the day after any such attack freddie forsyth will be saying that the government didn t do enough to protect the uk people like forsyth can only see one side of any argument and for him it is the side that is opposite new labour and tony blair i agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth the very reason this country has been such a wonderful place to live is under attack not from terrorists but from this government the perpetuation of the perceived terrorist threat is not because of what the alleged terrorists are doing but from our own government i believe what this government is doing is at the very least highly questionable and at worst sinister at what point will they feel they have enough control over every single person in the british isles when we are all tagged and monitored constantly our freedom is being craftily and surreptitiously whittled away by this government and we are gaining nothing it should be of great concern to everyone i am slightly older than mr forsyth and therefore have lived through the same history as him i am against a police state and would not like to think that i lived in one i think that the attack on iraq made the international situation worse and may have provoked further acts of terrorism how true there are extremely worrying parallels between britain now and germany during the 30 s i never thought it would be so easy to take over a country from within mr forsyth has forgotten one key point the terrorists who threaten britain today are well aware that hitler stalin and the ira all failed as a result modern day terrorists are willing to do things their predecessors did not that does not mean that the civil liberties of modern britain must be eroded to counter the threat that should always be the absolute last resort but to meet the new threat to defeat the sinister fanaticism of today s terrorists we may need to do things a little differently let us hope not frederic forsythe s comments seem to me to be a well thought out analysis of why we human society as a whole and britain in particular should resist the temptation to over protect through fear it is this fear which enables terrorists to succeed in the end and terrorists can come in all forms as mr forsythe s opening comments suggest i am reminded of a quote attributed to thomas jefferson a nation that limits freedom in the name of security will have neither the government are faced with an incredibly difficult task and have made a policy to deal with it it s all very well criticising that policy but if mr forsythe can t draw on his years of experience to offer an alternative i say so what to his opinions frederick forsyth s rhetoric is absurd and his conclusions laughable he distorts reality to serve his own prejudice against new labour this government seeks to balance protection of our democracy with minimum loss of civil rights it is frederick forsyth who is the extremist because he does not appreciate the need for balance i rarely find myself agreeing with my forsyth but in this instance i think he is correct the rule of law must prevail civil liberties are worth defending if the government can hold suspects without charge or trial what s next i agree absolutely by introducing fascist type laws we loose the moral high ground in our fight against terror our democratic system is not perfect but as churchill points out it is better than all the others that have been tried terrorist attacks will take place but for many reasons we should take that personal risk in return for personal freedom i do not usually agree with mr forsyth but he is spot on here the single biggest threat we face is that of a government dedicated to acting illegally and manipulating international and national law to suit its own purpose totalitarianism always requires an outside threat justifying a range of extraordinary powers leaders want the british government is a far greater threat that and terrorist organisation although in principle i agree with him frederick forsyth fails to address one key point al qaeda attacks though obviously there have been none yet in the uk seek to kill the maximum number of people the ira wanted to limit the death toll of their attacks so as to maintain support among the republican movement yes i agree with mr forsyth s views i do not believe the government s plans are justified there is over reaction to and the negative influence of the us president s interpretation of democracy and freedom he uses the same arguments that were current before the wwii the wars to liberate iraq afghanistan with syria and iran to come we are leaving a poor inheritance for the future generations mr forsyth is a wonderful writer and should keep his fiction where it belongs the british government is not going down the road that mr forsyth suggests sadly comments such as his will make a lot of people believe that they are governed by people who are fast becoming tyrants instead of being genuinely committed to stopping tyranny even if the method employed to do that is at the moment alien to the british people who have lived in a democracy protected by tony blair and others of like mind who mr forsyth seems to be putting along side the scruffy little austrian thomas hobbes would be smiling in his grave at labour s propositions like new labour he called himself a libertarian like new labour he believed he was promoting the people s best interests but as forsythe criticises this government hobbes has been criticised by most subsequent philosophers for arguing his way into the hands of the totalitarians simply put he argued that in favour of the ultimate liberty the liberty to live man should be prepared to surrender all other liberties to a supreme sovereign as protection against his fellow barbaric man hobbes has been roundly condemned by posterity and rightly so i hope new labour suffers the same treatment i agree with mr forsyth s views the governments approach is totally against the spirit of british democracy they must not be allowed to get away with it of course frederick is wrong about britain winning the war against the ira and he s wrong too about the country not becoming a tyranny has he forgotten about shoot to kill torture internment without trial collusion with loyalist death squads etc my background is somewhat similar to freddie s so i am persuaded to agree with many of his sentiments we can have no moral justification for imposing our system of government on anyone while we are systematically depriving our own citizens of basic individual and collective freedoms whilst the principle of keeping potential terrorists under house arrest might seem superficially attractive it is unfortunately also the first step towards totalitarianism who is to decide whom is a suspect why should we believe them who can have faith in the honesty integrity and competence of our intelligence services and politicians in light of the events of recent years what is to stop false denunciations what of those falsely accused who will lose their careers who will support their families will their children still go to school it smacks to me of the methods of nazi germany stalin s russia ceausescu s romania the list goes on it looks as if a new dark age is coming i see that opinion on mr forsyth s remarks are divided the problem i see is that those who support imprisonment without trial believe it will never happen to them or their family only to people they don t like or are scared of but history has shown that if you have laws like that they always get abused by those in power after all today you may be scared of the same people as those in power but someday those in power may be scared of you and that day you ll be the one imprisoned without the chance of justice our laws are such that you cannot just be imprisoned at the whim of our police forces you have to be shown to be deserving of it if we imprison people without trial for an indeterminate period we are no better that those we are fighting i never thought it possible for me to agree with a single word uttered by frederick forsyth but i m in wholehearted agreement with him on this one we as a nation are in grave danger of being duped by pro us propaganda which of course also means we ll inherit most if not all of their total paranoia and allow our governments of any political persuasion incidentally to gradually and insidiously impose a police state by well tried tested back door methods i grieve for the future of my children it s no wonder they re adamant they don t ever want any of their own this government with much fanfare signs us up to the european convention on human rights but now wants to introduce indefinite house arrest without trial this puts it on a par with the government of burma like many of your respondents i wouldn t usually think of mr forsyth as someone whose views i share but in the instance of opposing charles clark s proposals for house arrest i agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth i agree with mr forsyth just look at the facts our government along with the us invaded another sovereign country iraq by selecting intelligence that backed it s case based on fear the facts turned out to be very different if individuals are treated in the same distorted way then we ve done ourselves more damage than any terrorist organisation could with bombs we become animals too i agree in many ways with what mr forsyth has said if we are to be respected and have influence within the world we must be seen to be walking the walk as well as talking the talk how can we accuse countries such as zimbabwe and burma of human rights abuses when we are locking up people who may be totally innocent it is hypocrisy of the highest order mr forsyth links islamic fundamentalism to the new threat however it appears that he has misunderstood the term islamic fundamentalism it should be pointed out that a muslim who adheres to the true fundamentals of the qur aan and the teachings of the last prophet muhammad is an islamic fundamentalist this person does not commit suicide in any shape or form nor does she he kill innocent women men and children this person is self reflective and constantly tries to better her his actions by being good to others the people who mr forsyth labels the new threat are those who do not follow the correct teachings of islam they have arrived at their own interpretations and assumptions with regards their actions on top of that they claim to be following islam in its true form i accept that the intentions of these policies are to make britain a safer place but i cannot think of a single example from history where doing this sort of thing has ever made any difference in northern ireland internment certainly didn t achieve anything the bombings didn t stop and it could be argued that all it achieved was to just supply the ira with yet more angry and resentful republicans willing to take up arms against the british being eight years older than frederick forsyth and a survivor of the blitz on london it is easy to agree with him he is absolutely spot on during the ira bombings there were massive explosions in canary wharf to the right of where i write this and also to the left in the city of london notwithstanding these and the attempted and nearly successful assassination attempts on prime minister thatcher in brighton and on later occupants of 10 downing street there was no retaliatory blitz on belfast or dublin as there has been on afghanistan and iraq even when england was in true peril in 1940 apart from some detentions there were no wholesale derogation of habeas corpus and the like we have to see off these latest attempts on our liberties including id cards which winston churchill decided had to go since he said the average bobby on the beat could not be relied on to not be tempted to take undue advantage against the citizen going about their lawful activities incidentally i can still remember my old id card number hence it is clear that the far too great police state powers set for the statute books have to be resisted and neutered what can i add to mr forsyth s eloquently put arguments except applause well done that man for standing up and being counted in the war against tyranny

4,blair rejects tory terror offer tony blair has rejected a conservative compromise offer that could have eased the passage of anti terror legislation the tories wanted a sunset clause inserted in the anti terrorism bill that would have forced ministers to revisit it in november mr blair said the bill which brings in house arrest for terror suspects had time limiting safeguards already the tories say they will vote against it unless changes they want are agreed the lib dems also oppose the plans the government has already given way over the role of judges in house arrest cases mr blair s refusal to accept the tories sunset clause proposals means that the government faces concerted opposition from all sides in the lords peers begin three days of detailed deliberation on the bill on thursday the bill proposes control orders which as well as placing terrorism suspects under house arrest could mean curfews tagging or bans on telephone and internet use these would replace current powers to detain foreign terror suspects without trial which the law lords have ruled against as a breach of human rights the tories want judicial oversight of all control orders not just house arrest shadow home secretary david davis told bbc radio four s the world at one his primary concern was potential miscarriages of justice he said if someone was wrongly given a control order it would act as a recruiting sergeant for terrorists he went on to say if we don t get the amendments we regard as essential including the sunset clause we will vote against the bill in the commons mr howard said it would be far better if the whole of the legislation was subject to a sunset clause so parliament could consider it all in a proper way instead of it being ramrodded through mr blair said the house arrest powers were already going to be subject to a sunset clause because it was annually renewable the second less stringent type of control orders would be subject to a court appeal within 14 days and there would be a three monthly report on their use by an eminent and independent person i believe the new powers are a proper balance between the civil liberties of the subject and the necessary national security of this country that i will not put at risk said mr blair the lib dems plan to oppose the bill in the lords on thursday lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten said there s a lot of talking left i would be uneasy about supporting a very bad bill even if it was just for eight months a spokeswoman for human rights watch said it was a basic principle that people should only be punished after a fair trial she added having a judge impose those punishments without a trial does not sanitise them either

1,brussels raps mobile call charges the european commission has written to the mobile phone operators vodafone and t mobile to challenge the high rates they charge for international roaming in letters sent to the two companies the commission alleged the firms were abusing their dominant market position in the german mobile phone market it is the second time vodafone has come under the commission s scrutiny the uk operator is already appealing against allegations that its uk roaming rates are unfair and excessive vodafone s response to the commission s letter was defiant we believe the roaming market is competitive and we expect to resist the charges said a vodafone spokesman however we will need time to examine the statement of objections in detail before we formally respond the commission s investigation into vodafone and deutsche telekom s t mobile centres on the tariffs the two companies charge foreign mobile operators to access their networks when subscribers of those foreign operators use their mobile phones in germany the commission believes these wholesale prices are too high and that the excess is passed on to consumers the commission aims to ensure that european consumers are not overcharged when they use their mobile phones on their travels around the european union the commission said in a statement vodafone and o2 britain s other big mobile phone operator were sent similar statements of objections by the commission in july last year vodafone sent the commission a response to those allegations in december last year and is now waiting for a reply the vodafone spokesman said a similar process would be set in motion with these latest statement of objections about its operations in germany the companies will have three months to respond to the commission s allegations and the process may go on for some time yet the spokesman said the commission could charge the companies up to 10 of their annual turnover though in practice that sort of figure is rarely demanded the commission s latest move comes just a few months after national telecoms regulators across europe launched a joint investigation which could lead to people being charged less for using their mobile phone when travelling abroad the investigation involves regulators assessing whether there is effective competition in the roaming market
0,smart search lets art fans browse if you don t know art but know what you like new search technology could prove a useful gateway to painting artgarden developed by bt s research unit is being tested by the tate as a new way of browsing its online collection of paintings rather than search by the name of an artist or painting users are shown a selection of pictures clicking on their favourite will change the gallery in front of them to a selection of similar works the technology uses a system dubbed smart serendipity which is a combination of artificial intelligence and random selection it chooses a selection of pictures by scoring paintings based on a selection of keywords associated with them so for instance a whistler painting of a bridge may have the obvious keywords such as bridge and whistler associated to it but will also widen the search net with terms such as aesthetic movement 19th century and water a variety of paintings will then be shown to the user based partly on the keywords and partly on luck it is much more akin to wandering through the gallery said jemima rellie head of the tate s digital programme for richard tateson who worked on the artgarden project the need for a new way to search grew out of personal frustration i went to an online clothes store to find something to buy my wife for christmas but i didn t have a clue what i wanted he said the text based search was restricted to looking either by type of garment or designer neither of which he found helpful he ended up doing his present shopping on the high street instead he thinks the dominance of text based searching is not necessarily appealing to the majority of online shoppers similarly with art browsing is often more important than finding a particular object you don t arrive at tate britain and tell people what you want to see one of the skills of showing off the collection is to introduce people to things they wouldn t have asked for he said the tate is committed to making its art more accessible and technology such as artgarden can help with that said ms rellie she hopes the technology can be incorporated on to the website in the near future bt research is looking at extending the technology to other searching such as for music and films
1,us trade gap hits record in 2004 the gap between us exports and imports hit an all time high of 671 7bn 484bn in 2004 latest figures show the commerce department said the trade deficit for all of last year was 24 4 above the previous record 2003 s imbalance of 496 5bn the deficit with china up 30 5 at 162bn was the largest ever recorded with a single country however on a monthly basis the us trade gap narrowed by 4 9 in december to 56 4bn the us consumer s appetite for all things from oil to imported cars and even wine and cheese reached record levels last year and the figures are likely to spark fresh criticism of president bush s economic policies democrats claim the administration has not done enough to clamp down on unfair foreign trade practices for example they believe china s currency policy which us manufacturers claim has undervalued the yuan by as much as 40 has given china s rapidly expanding economy an unfair advantage against us competitors meanwhile the bush administration argues that the us deficit reflects the fact the america is growing at faster rate than the rest of the world spurring on more demand for imported goods some economists say this may allow an upward revision of us economic growth in the fourth quarter but others point out that the deficit has reached such astronomical proportions that foreigners many choose not to hold as many dollar denominated assets which may in turn harm growth for all of 2004 us exports rose 12 3 to 1 15 trillion but imports rose even faster by 16 3 to a new record of 1 76 trillion foreign oil exports surged by 35 7 to a record 180 7bn reflecting the rally in global oil prices and increasing domestic demand imports were not affected by the dollar s weakness last year we expect the deficit to continue to widen in 2005 even if the dollar gets back to its downward trend said economist marie pierre ripert at ixis

1,japan economy slides to recession the japanese economy has officially gone back into recession for the fourth time in a decade gross domestic product fell by 0 1 in the last three months of 2004 the fall reflects weak exports and a slowdown in consumer spending and follows similar falls in gdp in the two previous quarters the tokyo stock market fell after the figures were announced but rose again on a widespread perception that the economy will recover later this year on wednesday the government revised growth figures from earlier in 2004 which when taking into account performance in the most recent period effectively tips japan into recession a previous estimate of 0 1 growth between july and september was downgraded to a 0 3 decline a recession is commonly defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth although the japanese government takes other factors into account when judging the status of its economy figures released by the government s cabinet office showed that gdp on an annualised basis fell 0 5 in the last three months of 2004 however politicians remain upbeat about prospects for an economic boost later in the year the economy has some soft patches but if you look at the bigger picture it is in a recovery stage said economic and fiscal policy minister heizo takenaka gross domestic product measures the overall value of goods and services produced in a country the economy must be assessed comprehensively and we cannot look at gdp alone mr takenaka stressed ministers pointed to the fact that consumer spending had been depressed by one off factors such as the unseasonably mild winter analysts said the figures were disappointing but argued that japan s largest companies had been recording healthy profits and capital spending was on the rise japan s economy grew 2 6 overall last year fuelled by a strong performance in the first few months and is forecast to see growth of 2 1 in 2005 however the economy s fragile recovery remains dependent on an upturn in consumer spending a fall in the value of the yen and an improvement in global economies the results came in at the lower end of expectations but we shouldn t be too pessimistic about the current state and the outlook for the economy said naoki iizuka senior economist at the dai ichi life research institute japan s economy has seen stretches of moderate growth over the past decade but has periodically slipped back into recession

4,correction agency plans dropped plans to create a single correctional agency for scotland have been scrapped the scottish executive will not now merge the scottish prison service with local authority social work criminal justice departments the national correctional agency would have provided a one stop justice system but has been abandoned in the wake of stiff opposition instead scottish councils and the prison service will be compelled to work more closely to cut reoffending the plan was to ensure offenders were monitored by the same body during and after prison preventing many from being lost in the system and helping more of them to stop reoffending scotland s reoffending rate is high with more than 60 of prisoners reconvicted within two years of release from jail this is leading to an ever expanding prison population and the executive wants to tackle the problem ministers thought merging the prison service with the council controlled criminal justice social work departments which provide community sentences might have provided an answer however following a consultation on the idea justice minister cathy jamieson has decided to drop the plans instead ms jamieson will change the law to help produce a closer working relationship between both elements of the justice system she will announce the move in her criminal justice plan on monday aiming to break down the barriers between what happens in prison and what happens in the community the new measures will place a new statutory duty on the sps to work with local authorities and others in area partnerships a national advisory board on offender management will also be created to advise ms jamieson on the sps s role and performance in reducing reoffending the minister said better joint working will help prisons play a much stronger role in ending reoffending behaviour and in particular help address the revolving door of reoffending that sees offenders entering prison for short periods during which little is done to address the behaviour that brought them there communities who are paying the price for this reoffending both in terms of crime and in terms of prison costs expect better it costs the taxpayer 35 000 a year to provide each prison place and that cost is increasing taxpayers who suffer the consequences of crime also end up paying for keeping those people in prison therefore as we continue to invest in the service it is only right that we seek to ensure that that service becomes more accountable to the public it serves to ministers and to parliament

0,podcasts mark rise of diy radio an apple ipod or other digital music players can hold anything up to 10 000 songs which is a lot of space to fill but more and more ipod owners are filling that space with audio content created by an unpredictable assortment of producers it is called podcasting and its strongest proponent is former mtv host and vj video jockey adam curry podcasting takes its name from the apple ipod although you do not need an ipod to create one or to listen to a podcast a podcast is basically an internet based radio show which podcasters create usually in the comfort of their own home they need only a microphone a pc and some editing software they then upload their shows to the internet and others can download and listen to them all for free using technology based on xml computer code and rss really simple syndication listeners can subscribe to podcasts collected automatically in a bit of software which mr curry has pioneered the latest mp3 files of shows can then be picked up by a music playing device automatically mr curry records hosts edits and produce a daily 40 minute podcast called the daily source code he wants to make podcasting the next big thing and says it is an extension of his childhood love of radio gadgetry i was always into technologies and wires he explains my parents gave me the radio shack 101 project kit which allows you to build an am transmitter and subsequently an fm transmitter i had my mom drive me around the block see how far it would reach on the car radio mr curry is american but he grew up in the netherlands where he hosted illegal pirate radio shows in the dutch capital he tried university in the us and ended up back in holland where he hosted a music video show he spent the next seven years in new york where he worked at mtv hosting the top 20 video countdown but spent most of his hours tinkering with this new thing called the internet at a certain point in 1995 i was driving in on a friday afternoon beautiful blue sky one of those beautiful days thinking this is so stupid you know i m going do the top 20 countdown take the cheque go home and sit on the internet until three in the morning so after i finished the show i quit i said on air it s been great i ve been here for seven years at that point there s something on the internet i ve got to go find it and i ll see you later but mr curry s technology and broadcast interests started to gel a couple of years ago when computer storage was growing exponentially and high speed internet connections were becoming more widely available the mp3 format also meant that people could create and upload audio more cheaply and efficiently than ever before most importantly mr curry says people across the globe were bored with the radio they were hearing listen to 99 of the radio that you hear today it s radio voices and it s fake it s just fake he wanted to make it easier for people to find real voices on the internet he wanted software that would automatically download new audio content directly onto players like ipods mr curry is not a computer programmer so he asked others to create one for him no one did so he tried to write one himself he finished it a few months ago and says it totally sucked he put it up on the net as open source software and now dozens of coders and audio junkies are refining it the result is a work in progress called ipodder doug kaye a california based podcaster praises the former mtv vj for what he has done adam created a simple script that solved what we call the last mile problem ipodder takes audio from the web and brings it all the way down to the mp3 player he explains people can wake up in the morning pick up their ipods as they go to work or before they go exercise and discover that there s all this new content automatically put onto their players it is created an explosion in podcasting content and podcasters are springing up in australia finland brazil even malaysia one couple broadcasts theirs the dawn and drew show from wisconsin in the us sometimes even from the comfort of their own bed topics range from the comfort of their bed to the latest films or music and have thousands of listeners already websites are springing up that point listeners in the right direction of good podcasts chris mcintyre runs podcast alley and says that there are good sites out there but that not everyone has the technological know how to simply listen if i were to tell my mom or my mother in law to copy an xml or rss file to their podcast aggregator they would think i was speaking a foreign language mr mcintyre says along with technical challenges there may be legal challenges to podcasters who air their favourite albeit copyrighted music some in podcasting also worry that too much attention may turn what they see as the anti radio into something that is more like conventional broadcasting already there is interest in podcasting from the corporate world heineken is doing its own podcast now and so is playboy for his part adam curry s pressing ahead with his own vision of what podcasting should be he loves doing the daily source code because it is about introducing good music and cool ideas to new audiences he has even been called the ed sullivan or johnny carson of podcasting which he says is a badge i ll wear with great honour to be the johnny carson or ed sullivan of anything is wonderful and you know what you don t need a hell of a lot of talent you just have to be nice have your ears open and let people shine and that s good for me clark boyd is

3,brits debate over urban music joss stone a 17 year old soul singer from devon beat dizzee rascal jamelia lemar and the streets to win best british urban act at the brit awards her victory has reignited the debate about what urban music is i m not really comfortable with the word urban it s a word that s been manufactured in this country and america to describe black music the word urban seems to cover such a broad range of black music that it s wrong how far are the brits removed from inner city music and what people are doing it s so far removed that i don t expect them to get it bang on the music industry isn t championing music from our particular genre very well anyway people don t feel like that s anything to do with us i don t feel like urban music s just been celebrated by joss stone winning or her being nominated or by the brits acknowledging that there s an urban music scene because it s all a kick in the teeth at the end of the day it s not really relevant if joss stone is the closest thing that they feel comfortable championing because of what she looks like and how she sounds and who she s signed to then so be it it s got nothing to do with what s really going on urban as a genre is very broad if you look underneath urban there are a number of core elements that include hip hop r b garage and into that obviously comes soul joss stone is a soul artist her first album was called the soul sessions so urban is a very broad brushstroke that is the umbrella over the top of sub genres and there are offshoots of all of those joss stone has had amazing success in the us given that she s a uk artist what has really captured everybody s imagination is that here you have a 17 year old from devon with a voice to die for and a bunch of really really good tunes and she looks good i think that s what s done it the award for best british urban act was voted for by viewers of mtv base i don t think joss was not a worthy winner she makes soul music and that definitely comes under the category of what we describe as urban the fact that she s from devon is the interesting thing because most of the music we cover is made in large cities and she s literally rural the great thing about urban music is that there s a big range if there is some sort of root with black music or dance music in britain i think that s where you can call it urban that s where this new sub category or uber category has come from joss stone is certainly not old enough to have had some of the experiences of an older soul singer but you couldn t argue that she was being inauthentic with her emotions it is coming from somewhere genuine it has to come across as real that s the only cut off point we have here and that s the only way by which we judge people what urban means to us as an organisation is the politically correct term to describe music which originated from a black background music should become inclusive and if we are fighting for a multi cultural britain then we should be fighting for inclusion rather than exclusion if joss stone can be accepted within the urban music community i think acts from other ethnicities doing classical music and rock should be accepted too race doesn t make a difference if everyone is included out of all the awards dished out yesterday i m still trying to find out what people of other races received any sort of recognition or award a type of music especially street music that originates from a city and typically reflects or is characteristic of urban life she might not be urban but when did r b become the hip hop tainted thing it is now r b stands for rhythm and blues remember that joss stone is rubbish is certain if anyone deserves to win an award for urban music i think probably should include hip hop soul funk at least but not rock or pop this year its the streets although dizzee rascal stakes a good claim she definitely deserved to win a prize joss stone s albums are quite simply amazing easily better than anything else that was released last year this whole debate about what is urban what isnt urban is completely pointless and probably fueled by urban artists who weren t nominated or didn t win i cant see why people can t just congratulate her for the talent that she is she did deserve it but i agree with the comments about urban music its a stupid phrase and particularly british in the states they tend to use hip hop and r b if i say hip hop here a lot of people have no idea what i m talking about very strange what s in a name a rose by any other name etc if people want to call it urban why not if we really analysed it the term dance music is misleading because it doesn t describe everything you can dance to whilst i agree that the term urban is open to interpretation it strikes me as simply weird that joss stone has won urban to me is what i hear being played in parties in the inner cities i live in brixton and have never heard the soul sessions pumping out of of a bass heavy sound system in any parties i ve been to good luck to joss stone let s celebrate her victory let s also question why with artists so successful and talented as jamelia lemar kanye west dizzee rascal alicia keys and outkast we didn t see a single black artist on stage collecting an award so what you re saying is that any music that has black heritage is not allowed to be sung by anyone who isn t black and if it is then they shouldn t be acknowledged for it even if they re pretty dam good at it she s 17 has an amazing voice and won good on her oh but she s not black well let s make her feel real bad about it then how dare she though hang on didn t the so called public vote on this one this idea of pigeonholing whatever is popular at the time is no different than what was happening in the 1940s and 50s in relation to what jazz was the media then called anything that had a swinging beat syncopated melody or soulful feeling jazz much to the chagrin of the artists it would mean that blues would be put in the same mould as bebop cool and ragtime all very different styles at that time jazz was and remains such a massively misunderstood term and so what of urban music in truth it s a lazy term to categorise music that you don t really understand soul and garage are worlds apart musically marvin gaye v tuff jam but no doubt have their connections if we just let the music speak for itself and not judge the success of an artist by the number of awards won then maybe we can enjoy the music for what it is rather than what it represents i demand a prize for rural music sucks to the cities it s way better out here we have hay for one thing excluding her from what has become known as urban music would be as bad as excluding lenny kravitz or hendrix from rock music for being black surely i dont understand the point that ty is making if lemar who makes music which is less soulful than joss work won he might have said nothing btw i m black too how can she be urban if she spent most of her life in the devon countryside nonsense i love joss to bits and don t care what her branding is it s amazing music full stop stop puting it all in brackets and let s just call it music and let s especially drop the black urban tag nearly all music came from black origin this just sets an example that it is ok to pigeonhole people and their music by their colour surely the point of having an urban music category is simply to acknowledge artists that are making what is historically considered urban music irrelevent of the colour of their skin or where they originate from joss stone is simply singing a certain type of music that can be considered urban in style just as someone from an inner city and indeed not from the usa could sing country music if that person was good at it and authentic in sound would we criticise it being referred to as country music or the artist for representing that style the term urban in reference to a music genre in uk has developed in part from the controversy surrounding the branding of the mobo awards the very term music of black origin has confused and offended many people this is particularly strange given the existence of the asian music awards it appears that the use of black or white in relation to music makes people feel uncomfortable the term urban therefore has been invoked to sidestep the debate of which type of music came first black or white thereby rendering the issue colourblind the result is now a redundant new debate as to what urban also means perhaps we should have created a new term altogether to describe the various strains of soul rnb and hip hop one which does not also mean something else as we have done with crunk urban is just a word that s come about recently to describe black music that s become popular now the word wasn t even in use or common use five of six years ago it s just a way of the industry clumping it all together without having to call it black music because some people are oversensitive and might call them racist for it i m in a band that has been called urban and i despise the label i d hate to think i belonged to any neat marketing niche because that s all it is ever since the music channels and record comapnies tried to fracture what they consider music of black origin these labels have been used to undermine the status of good music into a commodity look at all the tv broadcasters unable to reach young people without condesending they simply play some urban music on the soundtrack as if its some dreadful cheap lift music ignore the labels it is what it is just music as a black man i think i agree with some of the statements at least the statements made by the key executives black people should lead the music they invented we should stop calling a genre meaningless northing is meaningless the real question is would joss stone would have been that successful doing the music she was doing if she were black same thing with streets amy winehouse etc who s ever heard of terri walker or rhian benson they are both 10 times better than joss stone and both of them have won urban music awards and i think mobos but why not brits so what if joss stone won the urban awards her music is great soul and surely that is under the urban banner what if the streets had won would people be whining because mike skinner is white it seems that a lot of the fuss is about race where the real issue should be music and nothing else urban is pc version for saying black music i m not doubting ms stone s talent but why didn t jamelia or lemar get a brit this reminds me of what happened to craig david and soul ii soul in the past getting nominations are easy to get but picking up a brit seems to be the hardest thing refreshing to see people making reasonable intelligent comments on any topic these days more power to you people you have said it there is music you like and music you don t like who cares what label you put on it that entire category was a mess how can you have people like dizzee rascal up against joss stone its like putting eminem against bob geldof she should have been nominated for best british r b act joss stone deserved to win an award for her talents but i don t think it was very urban of her to sing angels with robbie williams urban is a nonsense term music of black origin well doesn t that include rock music made in the inner cities well almost all bands end up making music in london manchester etc and doesn t that make some weird implication that all black people live in cities it doesn t make any sense why does music have to be put into a genre it s music you like it or you don t simple as that i play in a heavy metal band we are urban music as far as i m concerned we live in cities and spend our working life in an urban environment it therefore directly shapes what we write musically urban seems to be the new name for all styles of black music why it needed a rebrand i don t know as the name is misleading oasis originate from a city and characterise the urban life they know therefore more than fit the term urban yet as they re a white rock band they won t be described as such joss stone has a fantastic voice and great timing and delivery what other reason do they need to award her the brit all this urban and other such categorisation is just the red tape of the music

4,anti terror plan faces first test plans to allow home secretary charles clarke to place terror suspects under house arrest without trial are set for their first real test in parliament tories lib dems and some labour mps are poised to vote against the plans mr clarke says the powers are needed to counter terror threats opponents say only judges not politicians should be able to order detention of uk citizens the government is expected to win wednesday s vote in the commons but faces a battle in the house of lords the prevention of terrorism bill was published on tuesday it proposes control orders which would mean house arrest in the most serious cases and curfews electronic tagging and limits on telephone and internet access for other suspects the two opposition parties are particularly worried that the control orders would initially be imposed on the say so of the home secretary rather than a judge tory shadow home secretary david davis warned of the potential for miscarriages of justice like the guildford four for which tony blair recently apologised as a result of the pressure on politicians to lock up terror suspects those pressures would be much more for a politician than they would on a judge and that s why we have serious concerns abut that approach he told bbc radio 4 s today programme mr clarke says he does not intend to use the house arrest powers now even for the 11 current terror detainees he also said that any decision he made would be reviewed by a judge within seven days the foreign terror suspects currently detained are mostly held at london s belmarsh prison they are held under laws which the law lords have ruled break human rights rules and which are due to expire on 14 march the new powers designed to replace the existing laws and meet the law lords concerns would apply to british as well as foreign terror suspects critics say that giving politicians the power to deprive uk citizens of their freedom is the biggest attack on civil liberties for 300 years opposition mps are also angry they will have only two days wednesday and next monday to debate the new plans before they pass to the house of lords but the government says the existing powers run out soon so must be replaced urgently in a rare move the tories and lib dems have jointly tabled a motion opposing the new bill saying the house arrest plans are excessive it argues decisions should be taken on a higher standard of proof and the plan wrongly infringes the right to liberty by failing to bring terrorists to trial where there is evidence mr davis told today it gives a minister for the first time in modern history the right to detain without trial without showing the evidence and indeed in some respects almost the allegation against the individual concerned he questioned why there was such a rush to introduce the legislation when mr clarke had indicated he was not planning to use the house arrest powers straight away liberal democrat home affairs spokesman mark oaten said we believe it should be the judge that takes decisions not politicians mr clarke said the security services and police backed his measures and it would be rash and negligent to ignore their advice nobody should doubt that terrorists at home and abroad wanted to attack the uk and its interests he argued

0,rings of steel combat net attacks gambling is hugely popular especially with tech savvy criminals many extortionists are targeting net based betting firms and threatening to cripple their websites with deluges of data unless a ransom is paid but now deep defences are being put in place by some of the uk s biggest net firms to stop these attacks increasing numbers of attacks and the huge amounts of data being used to try to bump a site off the web are prompting firms to adopt the measures net firms are realising that it s not just about anti virus and firewalls said paul king chief security architect at cisco there are more things that can be done in the network to protect data centres mr king said the only way to properly combat these so called distributed denial of service attacks was with intelligent net based systems many of the gambling sites suffering ddos attacks are in offshore data and hosting centres so any large scale data flood could knock out access to many more sites than just the one the criminals were targeting said mr king this overspill effect was only likely to grow as attacks grow in size and scale malcolm seagrave security expert at energis said the most common types of attacks hit sites with 10 megabytes of data over short periods of time bigger attacks sending down 200 megabytes of traffic or more were rarely seen he said it does feel like they are turning the dial because you see this traffic gradually growing he said so far there have been no attacks involving gigabytes of data said mr seagrave however he added that it was only a matter of time before such large attacks were mounted maria capella spokeswoman for net provider pipex said that when ddos attacks were at their height customers were getting hit every four to five days the defences being put in place constantly monitor the streams of data flowing across networks and pluck out the traffic destined for target sites it s about understanding what s genuine traffic and keeping attack traffic from going to the site she said we study the profile of their traffic and as soon as we see an anomaly in the profile that s when we start to get the backbone engineering boys to see if we are going to sustain an attack said ms capella this traffic can be hard to spot because ddos attacks typically use thousands of computers in many different countries each participating machine only sends a small part of the entire data flood typically these computers have been infected by a virus or worm which reports its success and the net address of compromised machines back to the malicious hacker or hi tech criminal that set off the virus hijacked computers are known as zombies or bots and collections of them are called bot nets many spammers rent out bot nets to help them anonymously send junk mail most of the zombies are based outside the country that hosts the target site so getting the attacking pcs shut off can be difficult often pipex and other net suppliers do get advance notice that an attack is about to happen the serious players tend to precede an attack with some kind of ransom e mail said ms capella we ask as part of the service we provide that customers notify us of anything they have in advance that would give us forewarning once an attack is spotted dedicated net hardware takes over to remove the attack traffic and ensure that sites stay up energis took a similar approach said mr seagrave we have technology out there that allows us to detect attacks in minutes rather than let network engineers spend hours pulling the information together said mr seagrave also net firms were starting to work more closely together on the problem of ddos attacks and pool information about where they are coming from information gathered on attacks and where they originated has led to some arrests he said energis also did its own intelligence work to get in insight into which sites criminal gangs plan to target we have people in places where they shouldn t be monitoring tech sites he said sometimes though he said spotting the next victim was easy you can see them going alphabetically through the list with the gambling sites trying one after another said mr seagrave
0,brainwave cap controls computer a team of us researchers has shown that controlling devices with the brain is a step closer four people two of them partly paralysed wheelchair users successfully moved a computer cursor while wearing a cap with 64 electrodes previous research has shown that monkeys can control a computer with electrodes implanted into their brain the new york team reported their findings in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences the results show that people can learn to use scalp recorded electroencephalogram rhythms to control rapid and accurate movement of a cursor in two directions said jonathan wolpaw and dennis mcfarlane the research team from new york state department of health and state university of new york in albany said the research was another step towards people controlling wheelchairs or other electronic devices by thought the four people faced a large video screen wearing a special cap which meant no surgery or implantation was needed brain activity produces electrical signals that can be read by electrodes complex algorithms then translate those signals into instructions to direct the computer such brain activity does not require the use of any nerves of muscles so people with stroke or spinal cord injuries could use the cap effectively the impressive non invasive multidimensional control achieved in the present study suggests that a non invasive brain control interface could support clinically useful operation of a robotic arm a motorised wheelchair or a neuroprosthesis said the researchers the four volunteers also showed that they could get better at controlling the cursor the more times they tried although the two partially paralysed people performed better overall the researchers said this could be because their brains were more used to adapting or that they were simply more motivated it is not the first time researchers have had this sort of success in brain control experiments some teams have used eye motion and other recording techniques earlier this year a team at the mit media labs europe demonstrated a wireless cap which read brain waves to control a computer character

0,mobile games come of age the bbc news website takes a look at how games on mobile phones are maturing a brief round up follows but you can skip straight to the reviews by clicking on the links below part two will follow on monday reviews of call of duty splinter cell pandora tomorrow lord of the rings and pocket kingdom will follow on monday if you think of snake when some mentions mobile games then you could be in for a bit of a surprise this is because mobile games have come a long way in a very short time even before nokia s n gage game phone launched in late 2003 many mobile operators were realising that there was an audience looking for something to play on their handset and given that many more people own handsets than own portable game playing gadgets such as the gameboy it could be a very lucrative market that audience includes commuters wanting something to fill their time on the way home game fans looking for a bit of variety and hard core gamers who like to play every moment they can life for all these types of player has got immeasurably better in the last year as the numbers of titles you can download to your phone has snowballed now sites such as wireless gaming review list more than 200 different titles for some uk networks and the ranges suit every possible taste there are ports of pc and arcade classics such as space invaders lunar lander and bejewelled there are also versions of titles such as colin mcrae rally that you typically find on pcs and consoles there are shoot em ups adventure games strategy titles and many novel games only found on handsets rarely now does an action movie launch without a mobile game tie in increasingly such launches are all part of the promotional campaign for a film understandable when you realise that a good game can rack up millions of downloads the returns can be pretty good when you consider that some games cost 5 what has also helped games on mobiles thrive is the fact that it is easier than ever to get hold of them thanks to technology known as wap push by sending a text message to a game maker you can have the title downloaded to your handset far better than having to navigate through the menus of most mobile operator portals the number of handsets that can play games has grown hugely too almost half of all phones now have java onboard meaning that they can play the increasingly sophisticated games that are available even the ones that use 3d graphics the minimum technology specifications that phones should adhere to are getting more sophisticated which means that games are too now double key presses are possible making familiar tactics such as moving and strafing a real option the processing power on handsets means that physics on mobile games is getting more convincing and the graphics are improving too some game makers are also starting to take advantage of the extra capabilities in a mobile many titles particularly racing games let you upload your best time to see how you compare to others usually you can get hold of their best time and race against a ghost or shadow to see if you can beat them a few games also let you take on people in real time via the network or if you are sitting close to them via bluetooth short range radio technology with so much going on it is hard to do justice to the sheer diversity of what is happening but these two features should help point you in the direction of the game makers and give you an idea of where to look and how to get playing too fast too furious digital bridges as soon as i start playing this i remember why i never play driving games because i m rubbish at them no matter if i drive the car via joystick or keypad i just cannot get the hang of braking for corners or timing a rush to pass other drivers the game rewards replay because to advance you have to complete every section within a time limit winning gives you cash for upgrades graphically the rolling road is a convincing enough evocation of speed as the palm trees and cactus whip by and the city scrolls past in the background the cars handle pretty well despite my uselessness but it was not clear if the different models of cars were appreciably different on the track the only niggle was that the interface was a bit confusing especially when using a joystick rather than the keypad to play fatal force macrospace a futuristic shooter that lets you either play various deathmatch modes against your phone or run through a series of scenarios that involves killing aliens invading earth graphics are a bit cartoon like but only helps to make clear what is going on and levels are well laid out and encourage you to leap about exploring both background music and sounds effects work well the scenarios are well scripted and you regularly get hints from the fatal force commanders weapons include flamethrowers rocket launchers grenades and at a couple of points you even get chance to use a mech for a short

2,a november to remember last saturday one newspaper proclaimed that england were still the number one side in the world that statement was made to look a little foolish by events later that afternoon at twickenham but it illustrated the wonderful unpredictability of test rugby at the highest level at the end of a richly entertaining autumn series the final weekend threw the world pecking order into renewed confusion with australia s triumph in london followed by france s capitulation to new zealand clearly there is no number one side in the world at the moment declared wallabies coach eddie jones on arrival back in sydney there are four five or probably six sides all competing at the same level and on any given day the difference between one side and another is only about 1 while that bodes well for rugby as a whole it also sharpens the sense of excitement ahead of what could be the most open six nations championship for a decade while the wallabies all blacks and springboks hit the beach before turning their attention to super 12 matters in the new year europe s finest have less than 10 weeks before they return to the international fray and for the first time in more than a decade it will not simply be a straightforward choice between england and france for the six nations title that owes much to ireland s continued progress and the belief that wales are on the verge of delivering a major scalp to cement the promise of their autumn displays who secured a first triple crown in 19 years last season could go one better and win their first five six nations title since 1985 they start with away games against italy and scotland before england and france come to lansdowne road their momentous victory over the springboks can only bolster ireland s self belief while ronan o gara s late drop goal to deliver victory over argentina was further proof that eddie o sullivan s side can now close out tight games not that england or france who have won nine of the last 10 six nations titles between them will lay down quietly dismantling of the springboks suggested that even after the loss of such influential figures as martin johnson and lawrence dallaglio they still have the personnel to prosper the narrow defeat to australia was a timely reminder that not everything is blooming in the red rose garden but the fresh shoots of post world cup recovery have been sown by new head coach andy robinson a fresh desire to regain former heights is evident and if england emerge triumphant from an opening six nations engagement in cardiff a fourth title in six years is within reach are in familiar revival territory but this time it appears there is substance behind the rediscovered style while south africa s over confidence in cardiff made for a closer scoreline than expected wales could legitimately claim to have had victory within their grasp against the all blacks in one of the best tests in recent memory if mike ruddock can coax a reliable set piece platform from his pack there is no reason why victories should not ensue come february the last fortnight has left in a state of bewilderment after an autumn series that began with a superb victory over australia a stunning defeat to argentina their first loss since the world cup could have been attributed to trademark french inconsistency but the manner of new zealand s 45 6 demolition job in paris has coach bernard laporte bemoaning a lack of young talent coming through to replace the old guard fortunately for the french the opening match of the six nations sees them entertaining in paris after two reasonable performances against australia the scots humbling by the springboks forced coach matt williams to reassess his belief that a win over one of the major nations was imminent while individuals such as chris cusiter and ali hogg enhanced their reputations a lack of top class players will continue to undermine their best efforts who start with home games against ireland and wales before travelling to scotland are also hopeful of registering more than one victory for the first time in the championship as autumn gives way to winter and the heineken cup prepares to resume centre stage meantime the joy of six will keep the home fires burning until february

0,a question of trust and technology a major government department is without e mail for a week and technology analyst bill thompson wants to know what happened a couple of weeks ago i wrote about how my girlfriend had suffered when her cable modem blew up and she was offline for several days it seems that thousands of civil servants at the uk s department of work and pensions went through the same thing last week it has emerged that the internal network crashed in a particularly horrible way depriving staff of e mail and access to the application software they use to calculate people s benefit and pension entitlement or note changes in personal circumstances senior consultants from eds the computer firm which manage the system and microsoft which supplied the software were running around trying to figure out what had to be done to fix it all while staff resorted to phone fax and probably carrier pigeon to get work done fortunately the back office systems which actually pay people their money were still working so only new claims and updates were affected done properly this is bad enough for those affected but it does mean that the impact is not devastating for millions of pensioners i am sure regular readers will be expecting one of my usual diatribes against poor software badly specified systems and inadequate disaster recovery plans although the full story has not yet been told it seems that the problem started when a plan to upgrade some of the computers from windows 2000 to windows xp went wrong and xp code was inadvertently copied to thousands of machines across the network this is certainly unfortunate but i have a lot of sympathy for the network managers and technology staff involved today s computer networks are large complex and occasionally fragile the interconnectedness that we all value also gives us a degree of instability and unpredictability that we cannot design out of the systems it is the network equivalent of godel s theorem any system sufficiently complex to be useful is also able to collapse catastrophically so i will reserve judgment on the technology aspects until we all know what actually happened and whether it was a consequence of software failure or just bad luck what is really disturbing and cannot be excused is the fact that it took four days for news of this systems failure to leak out into the technical press it is without a doubt a major story and was the second or third lead item on bbc radio 4 s today programme throughout friday morning so why did not the prime minister s official spokesman mention it at any lobby briefings before friday why was not the pensions minister in parliament to make an emergency statement on tuesday when it was clear that there was a serious problem if there had been an outbreak of legionnaire s disease in the air conditioning system we would have been told but it seems that major technology problems do not merit the same treatment while eds and microsoft will no doubt be looking for technical lessons to learn from their week of pain we can learn some political lessons too and the most important is that in this digital world technology failures are matters of public interest not something that can be ignored in the hope that nobody will notice care or understand that means we need a full report on what went wrong and what was done to fix it it would be unacceptable for any of the parties involved to hide behind commercial confidentiality or even parliamentary privilege a major system has evidently collapsed and we need to know what went wrong and what is being done differently anything less is a betrayal of public trust bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital
4,kilroy launches veritas party ex bbc chat show host and east midlands mep robert kilroy silk has said he wants to change the face of british politics as he launched his new party mr kilroy silk who recently quit the uk independence party said our country was being stolen from us by mass immigration he told a london news conference that veritas latin for truth would avoid the old parties lies and spin ukip leader roger knapman says he was glad to see the back of mr kilroy silk mr kilroy silk promised a firm but fair policy on immigration and said they hoped to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election he said veritas would also announce detailed policies on crime tax pensions health and defence over the next few weeks and he announced the party would be holding a leadership election on thursday he is due to announce which constituency he will run in at the next general election that will come amid speculation he has his sights set on defence secretary geoff hoon s ashfield seat he was joined in the new venture by one of ukip s two london assembly members damien hockney who is now veritas deputy leader ukip s chairman petrina holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left mr kilroy silk announced his decision to quit ukip at a public meeting in hinckley leicestershire last week it came after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party he said he was ashamed to be a member of a ukip whose leadership had gone awol after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last june s european elections while ukip has turned its back on the british people i shall not he said i will be standing at the next general election i shall be leading a vigorous campaign for the causes i believe in and unlike the old parties we shall be honest open and straight mr hockney also left ukip saying mr kilroy silk would deliver better as the leader of a eurosceptic party a spokesman for ukip called on mr hockney to quit the london assembly the party asserts that mr hockney has a moral obligation if not a legal one to stand down its leader roger knapman has said he is glad to see the back of mr kilroy silk he has remarkable ability to influence people but sadly after the european election it became clear that he was more interested in the robert kilroy silk party than the uk independence party so it was nice knowing him now goodbye he said ukip officials also argue mr kilroy silk has not been straightforward in attacking the party he once wanted to lead this is just what the europhiles pray for as the main eurosceptic party ukip should try to resolve its differences with kilroy to show a united front and give the uk public a serious political voice against europe having multiple parties with the same view point just splits the vote further thank goodness that kilroy silk has gone now ukip at least has a chance in the election it is very sad to see the cause of britain regaining its proper relationship with europe damaged by this split within ukip robert kilroy silk could have a lot to offer instead we have a split party and a damaged cause under the present electoral system people must work together and small parties have no hope of representation last summer ukip achieved a major advance partly and only partly due to kilroy silk it is a great shame this has been dissipated in in fighting ukip has a wide platform of policies not just withdrawal from the eu this kilroy silk conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of his own party neither the english democrats nor the new party were interested in letting him join them and take over their leadership speaks volumes veritas is the beginning of the end for kilroy silk if he believes in truth and democracy then he and the two assembly members should resign and force a by elections to stand on their own platform rather than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then defecting to another so ukip was good enough for him to lead not good enough for him to follow interesting that a party committed to plain speaking should have a latin name every opinion poll points to an overwhelming anti europe feeling in this country kilroy silk could be on the verge of something huge if he can broaden his appeal beyond this one issue he is an extremely able communicator with years of political experience we wants quality schools top hospitals clean and efficient public transport punishments that fit the crime limited asylum a purge on bureaucracy and less taxes it needs courage and honesty two qualities sadly lacking in our politicians kilroy silk may just have those very qualities recruit the right colleagues robert and your time may have come well if you cannot get enough limelight being an ordinary mp then go out and start up your own party it s all flash and no real policy here let s hope this is the start of both ukip and kilroy silk slipping into obscurity veritas the name will doom it but perhaps i am wrong for surely all modern schoolchildren will understand it since they do still learn latin in the classroom do they not the whole essence of what rks represents is euroscepticism so explain to me how the too twee label of veritas symbolises that

4,no to royal succession shake up a labour peer has withdrawn proposals to give female members of the royal family the same rights as males the legislation would have ended the right of male heirs with older sisters to succeed to the crown it would also have torn up ancient legislation banning heirs to the throne marrying roman catholics but the government refused to back lord dubs succession to the crown bill saying it was too complex and raised too many constitutional issues the lord chancellor lord falconer agreed the 1701 act of settlement which governs the succession was discriminatory but added that for all practical purposes its effects are limited the changes proposed by lord dubs were a complex and controversial undertaking raising major constitutional issues he said lord falconer said there were 22 members of the royal family in the line of succession after the prince of wales all of who were eligible to succeed and had been unaffected by the act it is not a simple matter that can be tinkered with lightly while we wish to remove all forms of discrimination this isn t the proper form he added he did not rule out change in the future but said if lord dubs private member s bill was passed by peers he would urge mps to oppose it in the commons lord dubs agreed to withdraw his bill after its second reading in the house of lords but urged the government to think again at a later stage we cannot forever say we don t want to change things because it is too difficult he told peers during the debate the labour peer and former minister said the monarchy should symbolise the values of this country what we don t want is a situation where the values of the country have moved on and the monarchy is centuries behind the times we are surely all opposed to discrimination on the grounds of gender and we are surely also opposed to discrimination against catholics but opponents of the bill including tory lord campbell of alloway and the bishop of winchester the rt rev michael scott joynt said it would separate the state from both the church of england and the christian faith such a secular state would be markedly less tolerant rt rev scott joynt argued

0,call for action on internet scam phone companies are not doing enough to warn customers about internet rogue dialling scams according to premium phone line regulator icstis it has received 45 000 complaints in recent months about dial up internet connections diverting to premium rate numbers without users knowledge phone companies refuse to pay compensation because they say calls must be paid for they must warn people earlier about possible fraud icstis said people who use dial up connections can be affected by the scams without realising a program can be downloaded which diverts internet calls via a premium phone line victims often fail to notice until they receive an unusually high bill icstis spokesman rob dwight said phone companies should get in touch with their customers sooner if my bill goes over the usual 50 a month i want to know about it straight away i don t want to be told when it s hit 750 phone companies had the systems in place to spot fraudulent activity and artificially inflated traffic he said we alert them to the numbers that we have under investigation and they should be looking out for these numbers he added telecoms ombudsman elizabeth france said certainly i would not be surprised to find my credit card company phoning me if i do something out of the ordinary so i would expect phone companies to be looking to see if they can have a similar approach the biggest phone company bt says it is doing what it can to monitor fraud and warn people about rogue dialling its advice to customers is to use call barring if they want to prevent calls to premium lines because under the current system once the call has been made there s little that can be done gavin patterson group managing director for bt consumer said we do look at customer s calling patterns and we do make interventions when they are out of the ordinary we re looking at the moment at whether we can improve this but as bt handled 180 million calls a day monitoring was quite a task in itself he added the government has ordered a review of premium line services and is likely to say icstis should have more power to deal with rogue diallers in future at the moment it cannot demand pay outs on the behalf of customer it can only close illegal services down i use free anti virus software avg and free firewall protection zonealarm both of these tools have prevented unauthorised access and outgoing calls inadvertently and innocently caused by my daughter s love of music sites how about isps informing all customers of such facilities the responsibility clearly falls with the customer but many fall prey through simply not knowing how to avoid these issues ignorance is and always has been an expensive business does any one know what happens once this fraud has been committed and recognised the phone companies pay the people who obtaining money fraudulently so are these people followed up and prosecuted these diallers are mainly downloaded from sites offering illegal mp3s porn and pirated software if people didn t visit such sites they d be considerably less at risk whatever happened to personal responsibility it seems everyone has to be a victim these days part of the blame has to rest with the manufacturers of home computer operating systems a secure system should not allow a web page or email to download and install anything without the user s knowledge these scams are illegal and telephone companies should have nothing to do with them they should refuse to pay money over to the perpetrators or are they themselves receiving such good returns that it is in their interest to keep the scam going why don t bt et al block all premium numbers by default and only turn it off at the customer s request to anyone who falls foul of this scam refuse to pay your telephone provider for these calls after you notify your telephone provider of these fraudulent transactions they cannot insist on you paying the bill to do so would be to knowingly assist the fraudsters to commit the fraud no customers have yet been taken to court for refusing to pay these bills disable or remove your modem and use broadband instead then you have nothing to worry about or buy some decent firewall software and anti virus you would not walk out in the freezing cold without a coat you would not drive your car without any insurance so why not protect your pc stop blaming the phone companies it s not their fault i was very impressed with our phone company recently i had kept ringing a hotline number for kylie tickets and next day they rang back to ask if i was aware there were 40 odd calls to the same number great service and i got the tickets as well i have a colleague who has fallen victim to this kind of scam he informed the phone company about it they subsequently put a block on premium rate numbers three months later another huge bill of over 1 000 came in the block apparently didn t work and he still has to pay for it even though a block was in place phone companies are probably quite happy for their customers to be hit with a huge bill otherwise they d be taking extra steps to prevent this kind of problem i have been scammed of 139 the operator will do nothing about this and to add insult to injury i was charged vat by the government premium rate numbers have been subject to various scams ever since they were invented one example was where thieves would set up a premium rate number and then dial it day and night from phones whose quarterly bills were never paid the telephone company was the victim here and you can bet that loophole was blocked very quickly i know people who have run up large bills despite being it literate from talking to bt in belfast i believe that they will shortly be giving out a free application that can stop you dialling expensive numbers without knowing it s not the fault of phone companies and at last they are doing something about it it s about time that the profiteering by the legitimate phone companies came to an end mainly by doing away with dial up altogether and bring broadband down to the same price as dial up not only will this ruin things for the dialler scammers but also allow people to update and upgrade their security more easily and quickly i haven t fallen victim to a rogue dialling scam but i think you re seriously remiss in not pointing out that the vast majority of these scams arise from people trying to access services purporting to provide free pornography in most cases the user is entirely at fault which is probably why the telephone companies are rightly unwilling to refund them my telephone supplier did not inform me that my monthly bill had risen from its normal 3 to 5 to 320 this was because of the scam they simply billed me what particularly galls me over and above having over 300 stolen is that the supplier and the government through vat are profiting from this crime and will not reimburse me their portion of my losses how about an automatic monthly cap of say 20 on premium rate calls that you would have to contact your provider to have lifted that way you could use legitimate premium rate numbers while limiting fraudulent usage at least any disputed amount would be limited far easier for a telecoms operator to write off 20 than it is 750 a few years back i was also the target of such scams but thank god i have already upgraded to broadband and nothing was connected to my modem so all i heard was the sound of an attempted connection how about home users take some responsibility and ensure their anti virus and firewall software

4,asylum children to face returns the uk government is planning to return asylum seeker children without parents to albania the trial scheme which could start in weeks may be extended to apply to children from other countries children s charities have reacted with alarm saying the policy amounts to forcible removal and may not guarantee the safety of those affected but the home office says it may be in the children s best interests if it reunites them with their communities the pilot included in the government s five year immigration plan aims to return unaccompanied asylum seeking children from albania who have failed in their asylum claims since 2002 at least 9 000 under 18s have arrived in the uk to seek asylum without other family members these children automatically become the responsibility of social services up to now ministers have held back from final removal orders against unaccompanied children until after they are legally adults at 18 at least a dozen albanian born teenagers are thought to have been identified for return according to sources although there is no public confirmation of numbers those selected could either be returned to their families should they be traced or placed in the care of other albanian authorities separate negotiations to establish a family tracing and returns scheme are believed to be underway with another country under the 1989 children act public bodies have a duty to act in the best interest of a child in their care laura brownlees of save the children said there were grave concerns not least because of the well documented trafficking of children into crime and prostitution in albania if children are going to be returned then there should be proper assessments and decisions on a case by case basis she said we do not think there are structures in place to receive returning children in albania if these decisions are not in the best interests of the child then that is a forced removal because the child will not have any choice in the final decision in its five year immigration plan announced on tuesday the government said it was addressing the difficult issue of returning unaccompanied asylum seeking children a spokesman for the home office said it was wholly wrong to suggest that the plan was to return children and leave them to rot we are developing a returns programme for unaccompanied asylum seeking children whose asylum and humanitarian protection claims have been refused said the spokesman we have been exploring how we can establish reception and longer term care arrangements in countries of origin and believe that it s possible to return children in a way that is in their best interests and is safe and sustainable we do not believe that it is right or in keeping with children s legislation that children who can return should remain in the uk indefinitely separated from their families and communities the spokesman stressed the uk would abide by its international human rights obligations only those children who could be provided with a carefully planned reintegration package would be returned he said but andrew hogg spokesman for the medical foundation for the care of victims of torture said ministers had so far failed to reassure agencies from what is so far known we strongly oppose the scheme because the welfare and best interests of the child will not properly be taken into account said mr hogg in albania particularly there is no statutory child care or protection structure the medical foundation has many serious concerns including the assessment process for suitability for return the degrading of best interests of the child principles and of child welfare and the lack of safeguards in the chosen countries a spokesman for the albanian embassy in london said it was the first it had heard of a scheme but did not rule out that there had been an agreement between the two countries

2,man city 0 2 man utd manchester united reduced chelsea s premiership lead to nine points after a scrappy victory over manchester city wayne rooney met gary neville s cross to the near post with a low shot which went in via a deflection off richard dunne to put united ahead seven minutes later the unfortunate dunne hooked a volley over david james head and into his own net steve mcmanaman wasted city s best chance when he shot wide from three yards in the first half in the opening 45 minutes united had looked unlikely to earn the win they needed to maintain any chance of catching chelsea in the title race their approach play was more laboured than patient and they managed to fashion just one chance a paul scholes header over the bar and city seemed to be content to sit back and try and hit their rivals on the break as the game settled into a tepid pattern only shaun wright phillips appeared capable of interrupting the monotony looking lively down the right and causing gabriel heinze problems wes brown also found wright phillips to be a difficult opponent when the tricky winger embarrassed him near the touchline wright phillips sublime skill and pace took him past brown and he delivered a pin point centre to the feet of mcmanaman but the former liverpool player demonstrated why he has never scored against united by side footing the easy chance wide john o shea was forced off after an earlier clash with sylvain distin and cristiano ronaldo came on to replace him he immediately caused ben thatcher some discomfort and looked set to inject some much needed pace into the united attack rooney was being well marshalled by dunne but that was all about to change after the break united poured forward and there was a renewed urgency about their play and when neville delivered a cross in a carbon copy of city s best first half chance rooney showed mcmanaman how to do it even if he needed the help of dunne s leg worse was to come for dunne who had been having a fine match on 75 minutes he scored a horrible own goal when attempting to volley clear rooney s cross and united seemed home and dry however city did fight back and fowler missed another great chance from close range and united keeper roy carroll saved well from kiki musampa but united could have a had a third late on when substitute ryan giggs hit the post manchester city boss kevin keegan we had a great chance to take the lead and the first goal was always going to be crucial we started off with a good tempo but then we allowed them to dictate the pace a bit too much but we still had four good chances two after we d gone 2 0 down the one mcmanaman missed was very similar to the one wayne rooney scored from manchester united boss sir alex ferguson it wasn t our best performance of the last three months but i think we re deserved winners at times especially in the first half we didn t play with enough speed but with cristiano ronaldo and ryan giggs on the speed improved derby games can be like that they can be scrappy dull horrible and it was maybe like that man city james mills bradley wright phillips 83 dunne distin thatcher shaun wright phillips barton macken 68 sibierski mcmanaman musampa fowler subs not used weaver onuoha flood booked fowler sibierski man utd carroll gary neville ferdinand brown heinze o shea ronaldo 33 keane fortune fletcher giggs 64 rooney scholes phil neville 84 subs not used howard bellion booked rooney scholes keane goals rooney 68 dunne 75 og att 47 111 ref s bennett kent

2,tv calls after carroll error spurs boss martin jol said his team were robbed at manchester united after pedro mendes shot clearly crossed the line but was not given the referee is already wearing an earpiece so why can t we just stop the game and get the decision right said jol after the 0 0 draw but at the end of the day it s so obvious that pedro s shot was over the line it s incredible we feel robbed but it s difficult for the linesman and referee to see it mendes shot from 50 yards and united goalkeeper roy carroll spilled the ball into his own net before hooking it clear jol added we are not talking about the ball being a couple of centimetres or an inch or two over the line it was a metre inside the goal what really annoys me is that we are here in 2005 watching something on a tv monitor within two seconds of the incident occurring and the referee isn t told about it we didn t play particularly well but i am pleased even now with a point although we should have had three mendes could not believe the goal was not given after seeing a replay he said my reaction on the pitch was to celebrate it was a very nice goal it was clearly over the line i ve never seen one so over the line and not given in my career it s really really over what can you do but laugh about it it s a nice goal and one to keep in my memory even though it didn t count it s not every game you score from the halfway line manchester united manager sir alex ferguson sympathised with tottenham and said the incident highlighted the need for video technology i think it hammers home what a lot of people have been asking for and that s that technology should play a part in the game ferguson told mutv what i was against originally was the time factor in video replays but i read an article the other day which suggested that if a referee can t make up his mind after 30 seconds of watching a video replay then the game should carry on thirty seconds is about the same amount of time it takes to organise a free kick or take a corner or a goal kick so you wouldn t be wasting a lot of time i think you could start off by using it for goal line decisions i think that would be an opening into a new area of football arsenal boss arsene wenger also used the incident to highlight the need for video technology when the whole world apart from the referee has seen there should be a goal at old trafford that just reinforces what i feel there should be video evidence said wenger it s a great example of where the referee could have asked to see a replay and would have seen in five seconds that it was a goal

4,drink remark acts as diversion the first minister s statement that it was okay to get drunk once in a while has diverted attention from the real issues it has been claimed jack law chief executive of alcohol focus scotland said jack mcconnell s comment was ill advised the media attention had helped to move the focus from scotland s binge drinking problems mr law said scotsman journalist hamish macdonell said he believed the bigger picture had been obscured by the remark mr mcconnell was speaking on monday to more than 100 secondary pupils from schools in the highlands about the problems of binge drinking and drink promotions the one sentence comment was immediately criticised by the scottish national party which accused him of encouraging young people to get drunk but the scottish executive has insisted mr mcconnell was speaking about adults and his comments were a recognition that people will get drunk mr macdonell political editor of the scotsman said i think we have to say right at the outset that this was a very stupid and ill advised remark by the first minister if you come out with something like this saying that by all means get drunk then you will be pilloried for it however he added that perhaps mr mcconnell could feel rightly aggrieved about the coverage mr macdonell said i think the problem here is that he did say a lot more things about binge drinking and under age drinking but that whole side of things has been lost in the furore over one sentence i understand why but i think there is a much bigger message here that has been obscured mr law from voluntary body alcohol focus scotland believed damage had been done to scotland s fight against binge drinking he said he accepted that young people drank and they did have problems with drink mr law added i think the remark was ill advised but these remarks are blown out of all proportion and they so easily misrepresent what we are trying to do in scotland we don t want to preach to young people but we need to acknowledge that they do drink problematically this diverts us from the real issues which are about promoting responsibility and reducing harm and indeed tackling our drinking culture which is a culture about binge drinking and drunkenness he said it was vital that young people were properly informed about the risks incurred to themselves and others when they got drunk mr macdonell said that the first minister should know by now that if he said things which were off the mark they were bound to come back and bite him he added here mr mcconnell was talking in the highlands to 100 teenagers and every word he said was put out on a webcast by the scottish executive and then looked at by other politicians and reporters i think in this instance he has done a lot of really good things and he will be regretting this remark the scottish national party s holyrood leader nicola sturgeon wrote to mr mcconnell on tuesday accusing him of an error of judgement and calling for him to apologise for his ill judged comment and withdraw it immediately in a furious response the first minister said his comments had been distorted and taken out of context he told ms sturgeon it is disappointing that you have contributed to this distortion by saying it is staggering that i should encourage young people to get drunk that is completely untrue perhaps it would have been wiser for you to find out what was actually said before you rushed to represent my position undermine the convener of education at highland council and insult the intelligence of the young people i spoke with all for the sake of a simple soundbite
