### **Difference between Telnet (Telecommunication network) and SSH (Secure Shell)**
|Telnet|SSH|
|---|---|
|Telnet is not secure as it does transfers data in plain text format, without any encryption, so security issues are there|SSH on the other hand encrypts the data before sending so that any mallory can get encrypted text and hence it is more secure than telnet|
|Telnet does not has User Interface it just runs from terminal| SSH can be accessed from terminal and UI as well|
|Telnet does not use any authentication mechanism|SSH uses public key authentication|
### **Encryption in SSH**
SSH protocol uses symmetric key encryption, 
asymmetric key encryption, hashing mechanisms for securing transmission, so ssh connects between client and server by following these essential steps:

1. verification/authentication of server
2. Then it generates a public key and encrypt the data for sending and using private key the receiver can decrypt the message
3. authentication of cilent
   
### **Why use Telnet ?**
We may need to use telnet as some of the old network devices allow telnet connections to them, and some of them are not compatible to some modern and advance protocols, that's why they use telnet protocol which exists even when internet was not there.

In telnet we can also do some fun stuffs like
1. watching star-wars in ascii
2. playing freechess
3. Interacting with AI Eliza
and much more ... 

### **Encryption of Telnet**
some methods to encrypt the Telnet Protocol:

1. **using SSL (secure socket layers)** - since telnet does not apply any security mechanisms so we can configure telnet servers with the ssl connection but in this process we require DCM (Digital Certificate Manager) for the certification purposes to use telnet server.
2. **using kerberos** - Kerberos is an authentication protocol that requires both client and server to prove their identities. so we can basically layer kerberos over telnet communications for the authentication purposes.
