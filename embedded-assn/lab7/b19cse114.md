1. if we expand 0xc0 then it comes out to be 11000000, observe that 6th and 7th pin is high, it means that we are enabling pin 6 and pin 7, as required

2. if we expand 0x5000 then it comes out to be (01 01 00 00 00 00 00 00), each of them represents 2 bits and notice that 6th and 7th pin is set to 01, which means that they are getting high for output mode

3. if we change 30000 to 50000 then delay(1200) would be more for same value (1200), which means that led's will blink after more dealy

4. yes, there is one typo in the program i.e GPIOB->ODR = Z, because we want output to be at GPIOA and not GPIOB 

5. Since, x and y both are of 8 bits and so z would be of 8 bits so we need 8 output moder pins to display the output of led's so we set it to 0x5555 (01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01) it directly means that 8 pins are set to output mode (01) to display ouput of led's
