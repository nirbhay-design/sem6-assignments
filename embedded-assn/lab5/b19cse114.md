- Edf algorithm: Current Implementation is preemtive in nature so some of the ordering of the process may be shuffled but the process are shuffled before the deadline
- Rms algorithm: Current Implementation is preemtive in nature and the process are scheduled before the deadline

### **Code Input and Output**

- Input: for providing input to the code just update the *inp* dictionary to provide the suitable $C_i$, $D_i$, and $P_i$

- Output format:

    - time -> process
    - so at each time stamp above format will show which process is scheduled at which time stamp
    - eg. (2 -> 0) shows 0th process is scheduled at 2nd time stamp

### **Run code**
```
$ python3 scheduling_algo.py
```

### **Evaluation of both algorithms**

*Correct examples*

```json
inp = {'capacity':[3,2,2],
        'deadline':[7,4,8],
        'period':[20,5,10]
    }
```

eg. output: Edf and Rms

*InCorrect Examples*

```json
inp = {'capacity':[1,2,3,4,4,5],
        'deadline':[4,6,8,10,12,14],
        'period':[4,6,8,10,12,14]
    }
```
eg output: Edf and Rms

<img src="incorrect_edf_rms.png" alt="incedf" width="550" height="200"/>

**Reason for not scheduling**
- In Edf a process is not scheduled if it is not completed before the deadline or the process arrives and still it has not completed similarly in Rms the process is not scheduled because it is not completed before its time period has arrived
- another reason for not scheduling a process in both the case is not satisfying the below conditions - 
    - Edf: $U = \sum_{i=1}^{k} {\frac{C_i}{T_i}} \leq 1$
    - Rms: $\sum_{i=1}^{k} {\frac{C_i}{T_i}} \leq U = n(2^{\frac{1}{n}}-1)$
    - if the above conditions are violated then also the process cannot be scheduled
